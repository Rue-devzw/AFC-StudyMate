        "sectionContent": "In the very beginning there was nothing at all. Darkness was everywhere. Then God created the heaven and the earth. On the first day of His Creation God said, \"Let there be light,\" and there was light! God called the light Day and the darkness Night.\n\nOn the second day of God's Creation, He wanted a sky to separate the water that was everywhere. He kept just enough water under the sky to use on His world. All the rest of the water He put high above the sky. God named the big sky Heaven. Whenever we look up into the sky and see the clear blue color, or the fluffy white clouds, or even the refreshing rain coming down we can know that God made it for us.\n\nThe third day was when God told the water under the sky to move together so dry land could be put in place. He named the dry land Earth. God put the water in oceans, lakes, rivers, and streams. He told the green grass and trees of every kind to start growing. It must have looked like a beautiful garden with all the different colors of flowers. God made seeds in everything that grew. That way, He knew that if someone wanted grass to grow they could just plant grass seeds. Or, if someone wanted an apple tree they could just plant apple seeds. God knew it was just what His world needed.\n\nOn the fourth day He told some special lights to shine in the sky. The sun was to be the bright light and warmth we would need for our daytime -- a time when we work and play. God knew that the plants would need this light so they could grow. Then God made the moon and the twinkling stars. They show just a little bit of light for our nighttime. That is a time when we need to sleep.\n\nEven the plants fold up and go to sleep at night. God loves us and gave us this quiet time.",

God took some dust from the ground and worked with it until it was shaped just right.\n\nHe gave Man two ears, two eyes, a nose, and a mouth. Then God gave Man something very different from all the rest of His creation. God breathed into Man and gave him a living soul. This made Man to be God's greatest creation because he could talk with God and love God. God called this first man Adam.\n\nOne of the special privileges God gave Adam was to name the animals. And he was, also, to take care of the beautiful place God had created. That would be a big job. God knew that Adam would need some help. He also knew that Adam would be lonely without someone of his own kind to talk to. So God caused Adam to go sound asleep.\n\nWhile he slept, God took a rib from Adam's side. God used that rib to make a woman. God also gave her a living soul. When Adam awoke, God brought him the woman He had made. God's plan was for the woman to be Adam's helper and wife. Adam named the woman Eve.\n\nGod wanted His people to be happy because He loved them very much. He had made a beautiful garden called Eden. He filled it with the best of His creation. That was to be Adam and Eve's home. They were happy to live there. God often visited with them in the Garden. They were good friends and they loved to talk and spend time together.\n\nWhen God had completed His creation, He set a good example for all of us to follow. He had worked for six days while He created the heavens and the earth. Then on the seventh day He rested. God knew this would be a good thing for all His people.",

God liked it.\n\nNow God wanted to plant a beautiful Garden in His world. He did not want just a flower garden or a garden with carrots, and peas and lettuce and things like that. He wanted a beautiful, beautiful Garden with big trees with all kinds of good fruit on them.\n\nSo God made the most beautiful Garden that ever was made. We can picture all kinds of pretty flowers in it, blue ones, red ones, yellow ones. Every color and every kind of flower was in that Garden.\n\nHe put in it all kinds of trees: pear trees, peach trees, apple trees. Oh, we cannot even tell how many kinds of trees grew there. Beautiful birds sang in the trees. Perhaps big butterflies flew here and there and little animals played in the bushes.\n\nThere was a river in the Garden, too. It watered the plants, and the little animals could get a drink from it. No one has ever seen such a beautiful Garden as God’s Garden was.\n\nGod wanted someone to live in the Garden so He made a man and gave him a name. God named His man, Adam. God did not want Adam to be lonesome so He made a woman, too, so Adam would have someone to talk to. Adam called her Eve.\n\nAdam and Eve lived in this pretty Garden. They did not have to work to keep the weeds out, because there were no weeds then. God did not make anything bad in the Garden. The roses did not have any sticker thorns in that first Garden. Adam and Eve did not have to buy food. They found what they wanted right there in God’s Garden of Eden and ate it.",

        "sectionContent": "A LONG, long, long time ago there lived a man named Noah. Noah loved God very much and prayed to Him every day. God loved Noah, too. Noah had a wife and three boys.\n\nMr. and Mrs. Noah and the three boys loved God. The whole family prayed to God and were happy to do anything God wanted them to do.\n\nThere were lots of other people in the town where the Noah family lived. These people did not love God one little bit. They were very, very naughty and bad. Anybody that does not love God is always naughty and bad because they do not have God’s love in their heart to help them be good. When you love God you just want to do good things. You do not want to do anything bad.\n\nGod would talk to Noah and tell him things to do. Noah could always hear what God said because he was listening in his heart for God’s voice. Noah was very careful to mind God all the time.\n\nOne day God talked to Noah and told him to build a great big, big boat. This was to be the biggest boat in all the world. God wanted the boat to be called an ark.\n\nThis great, big boat had to be big enough to hold all of Noah’s family and two of each of the animals and birds and everything that God made when He made the world. All the things that were alive. God wanted two of each kind to have a place in this ark boat.\n\nGod told Noah not to wonder what He would do with the big boat. God told Noah what it was for. You want to know what God told Noah? It is in the Bible so we can know what happened. God said, “Noah, I am going to make it rain and rain and rain.\n\nIt won’t stop raining for a long, long time. Noah, you and all your family and two of each of the living things I made, are going to have to live in this big boat while it is raining. You will be warm and dry there.”\n\nNoah had never made a boat before but he did not worry about how he was going to do it. He did not say, “I can’t.” Noah knew God would help him know just how to do it. God knows everything and just how to fix everything. He will tell people how to make things if they will pray and ask Him.\n\nGod told Noah just what kind of wood to get, how big to make that biggest boat in the world, how many rooms to put in it, where the only window had to be, and all the rest of the things Noah had to know to build that boat.\n\nThis ark boat was really God’s boat because God planned it and told Noah how to make it.\n\nIt was such a big, big, big ark boat it took a long, long time to make it. People could hear the bang, bang from the hammers pounding of Noah and his three boys.\n\nThe people that lived near Noah would look at that big boat and how they would laugh at him and make fun of him! They might have asked, “What are you making such a great, big boat for, Noah? There isn’t any water around here for a boat like that. That is too big.”\n\n“God told me to make this ark boat,” Noah would say, and then the people may have laughed real hard. They thought Noah was very queer to say that God told him to build a boat. They did not believe in God, so God could not talk to them as He did to Noah.\n\nNoah told the people it would rain so much it would cover all the ground and the mountains. “You had better pray,” Noah would say. “If God said He will make it rain that much, He will do it. I will need this big boat then.”\n\nNoah and his boys just kept working on the boat, no matter what the people said.\n\nSometimes people who live here in the world today laugh at other people for minding God. Other boys and girls might do it to you, too, but you just pray for them. They do not understand about God and how He can make them kind and good when they pray.\n\nLittle boys and girls who go to Sunday school can be just like Noah was. They can go right on doing what God tells them to do no matter how hard their little friends might try to get them to be naughty.\n\nOne day the boat was all finished. How big it looked! God was so happy with Noah for minding Him! Noah was happy, too.\n\nNow God said, “Noah, you and all your family must go into the boat. Take Mrs. Noah and your three boys. Take the wives of the three boys, too.” They went into the ark.\n\nAnimals started to come from everywhere. Two here, two from over there. They went right into the ark boat. Birds came, too. Oh my, so many living things, both great and tiny, tiny ones!\n\nLook, the Noah family is there, and two of each of all the living things God made are in there, and enough food for each one. What happened then?\n\nNoah did not even touch the door of that ark boat at all. Slowly, slowly, it started to shut. Do you know who did it? God did it. God shut the door of that great, big boat, Himself. He shut it tight. It would not blow open, no matter how the wind blew.\n\nSplash! Splash! Splash! What was that? Faster and faster came the hard rain that God had said He would send someday. The rain had started!\n\nIt rained and it rained and it rained. It never stopped raining for a long, long, real long time. God made that rain keep falling just like He said it would. What God had told Noah was true. The rain had really started and no one could stop it but God.\n\nThe ground was all covered with water and it was so deep that the people could not walk on it any more. Now the people wished they had not laughed at Noah. Noah was right after all, but it was too late for them to make a boat now.\n\nAfter a while all the big, high trees were covered with water. Even the tip-top of the tallest tree did not show any more. It rained and it rained, and it rained some more. Now all the big, high mountains were covered with water, too. There was not even a little tiny top of a mountain showing anywhere. The whole world was just like a great, big ocean with no land at all.\n\nIt had rained for forty days and nights. It did not stop even once, all that time.\n\nWhere was the big, big ark boat with Noah and his family? Just floating along on top of all that water. They were nice and warm, all the animals were fine.\n\nNoah and his family were glad they had listened to God and minded Him. We are always happy and safe when we mind God, too. He takes good care of every little boy and every little girl who loves Him. Yes, He does. He takes good care of big people, too.\n\nAt last the rain stopped. The water went away.\n\nGod told Noah it was time to come out of the big ark boat and to let all the animals and birds out, too. It must have seemed good to see the bright sun again.\n\nThe first thing that Noah did was to thank God for keeping them all safe from that big rain.\n\nGod talked to Noah and said, “I am going to put a beautiful rainbow in the sky.” This was a, promise from God that it would never rain so hard and long again.\n\nWhen you look up in the sky and see a pretty rainbow just know that it is God telling you He will never make it rain like that again.\n\nJust think — we can see the same kind of a rainbow that Noah did a long time ago! God is taking care of you, too, just like He did Noah.",

        "sectionContent": "ONE day God told Abraham to go far away to another place to live, to a beautiful country. Abraham minded God. He took his wife, Sarai, with him. He did not have any boy of his own. God had said someday he would give him one.\n\nAbraham took a man called Lot with him, too. Lot was Abraham’s nephew. Abraham was Lot’s uncle.\n\nAbraham did just what God told him. He left all his friends and began to go to the new country God told him about. He did not know where he was going but God did, so Abraham did not worry.\n\nIt was hard for Abraham to travel. They could not go in cars then. There were no cars. Abraham had many things and people and animals to take with him. Abraham was getting old now, too, but God said Go, so he was going, even if it was hard. Abraham was not afraid because he knew God was taking care of him.\n\nAfter a long, long, long time Abraham came to a place called the land of Canaan. Such a good country! There were nice trees with fruit growing on them, so good to eat. Green, green fields for the animals.\n\nAbraham and Lot lived together in this beautiful place. God gave Abraham many, many good things. He had lots and lots of sheep and cows, and men working for him to take care of all the animals. There was plenty of room for everybody and all the animals, too.\n\nLot also had many animals and men working for him. They would have been happy living all together but for one thing. The men who worked for Abraham and the men who worked for Lot became cross with one another. They would quarrel and fuss and say bad things to each other. Abraham was a kind and good man. He did not like to hear all that fussing and he knew God did not like it, either. My, but God does not like to hear a fuss! Abraham possibly thought, “I will go somewhere else. I do not want my men quarreling with Lot’s men. God is not happy over their quarreling and neither am I.”\n\nAbraham talked to Lot about it.\n\nThey went to a place where they could see all over the country, and Abraham told Lot to choose which land he wanted. Abraham did not say, “God gave me this land and I want to choose first.” No, Abraham loved God; and he did not act like that.\n\nLot was selfish. He took the very best land for himself. It was near a river. The grass was tall and green for his sheep. He took the very best place. Abraham took what was left. It was not as good as Lot’s but Abraham did not quarrel. Abraham knew God would take care of him no matter where he was.\n\nLot moved into a city called Sodom. He had not lived there long when some soldiers came to that city to fight. These soldiers ran off with most of the good things in the city. They took all the food. They took some people away with them, too. They took Lot.\n\nNow what was Lot going to do? He had been selfish, and look what happened to him. One of the men got away from the soldiers. He ran over to where Abraham lived and he said that Lot was in trouble. Abraham went right down there and got Lot away from the soldiers. He even got back all the things the soldiers had taken.\n\nAbraham had God’s love in his heart. He was glad to help Lot even if Lot had not been very good to him.",

        "sectionContent": "IT was a hot day. Abraham and his wife lived in a tent, like people used to do in that country. Their tent was out in the desert where it is hot, hotter than anywhere else.\n\nAbraham loved God. God loved him, too. On this hot, hot day Abraham went to sit in the door of his tent. He looked up and saw three men standing outside. Abraham knew they must be tired and hot from walking along the dusty road on such a hot day.\n\nAbraham did not even wait for the men to get close to him. He jumped up and went as fast as he could to meet them. He bowed to the ground before them and told them not to go any farther, but to stay there. Abraham said: “Rest yourselves under this tree, and I will get you. something to eat.” They said that they would stay a while.\n\nAbraham gave them some water to wash their poor, hot, dusty feet. How nice and cool that water must have felt on their tired feet! Abraham hurried back into the tent home and called to his wife, Sarah: “We have company. Hurry and bake some nice cakes for them.” Then Abraham ran to the field where his cows were eating grass. He looked all around until he found the best calf and he took it to his servants who cooked the meat for his company. After Sarah baked the cakes (something like bread) Abraham took the cakes, and the meat, and some milk and butter to the men who were resting beneath the tree; and they ate the dinner there. Abraham did not sit down with them, but stood nearby to see if they needed anything else. He gave them the very best he had; and he did all he could think of to help them. He did not even know who they were or where they were going. He just knew that God wanted him to help people and be kind to them.\n\nWho do you suppose these three men were? Who could they be who came so suddenly to Abraham as he sat at the door of his tent? They were Angels from Heaven dressed like men. One of them may have even been the Lord.\n\nAbraham was so glad he had done all he could to make them happy. He did not know they were Angels when he first saw them.\n\nJesus is watching little boys and little girls all the time. He watches grown people, too, to see if they are good and kind to someone who needs help. He wants all who love Him to be quick and ready to do any little kind act for someone who needs it.\n\nSomeday Jesus is coming back from Heaven to get everyone who loves Him. Someday God will open that great, big Book of Life where all the names are of the girls, boys, men and ladies who have no sin in their heart.\n\nSomeday Jesus is going to let the good people live with Him in Heaven. He won’t let any naughty people into Heaven.\n\nJesus will say to the ones who are saved and have no sin: You gave someone a drink of water when he was thirsty. You gave some clothes to a little girl or boy when he did not have any. He notices when you let someone come and stay at your house and maybe even sleep in your bed when he needs some place to stay, and you do not fuss about it. Maybe someone went to see a little sick friend and took him a toy of his very own so he would have something to play with. All these little, nice, kind things to someone else are just as if you were doing them to Jesus. Jesus said that in His Bible. When you show kindness and goodness to someone else, Jesus feels as if you are doing it to Him, too.\n\nBe good to Jesus by being nice to a little friend or even someone you never saw before.",

        "sectionContent": "A LONG, long time ago there lived a young man named Jacob. He lived with his mother and father and brother.\n\nOne day Jacob’s mother told him to go and visit his uncle. Jacob’s uncle lived a long, long way away. Jacob was going to have to walk all the way. There were not any busses or trains or cars in those days.\n\nJacob started out to go to his uncle’s house. Walk, walk, walk, he went. All day long Jacob walked. The roads were not smooth like our streets. They were rough and dusty. Maybe Jacob liked walking along the road at first. There were so many new things to see, but he probably was very tired by the time the day was over.\n\nAfter a while it started to get a little dark. Now Jacob walked slower and slower. He was getting tired and sleepy. There was not a single house out where he was. Not a hotel. Not any place for him to go to bed. He was going to have to fix a place to sleep there by the road.\n\nJacob was not afraid to sleep out there all by himself in the dark. Some boys and girls do not like the dark. God Himself made the dark. He made the moon and the stars to shine in the sky, to peek through the dark; and it is good to have a quiet time with God when it gets dark.\n\nJacob was not afraid. He must have moved some of the rocks to make a place that would not be too bumpy. He found some smooth rocks to use for a pillow. Then Jacob lay down and wrapped his coat around him.\n\nJacob lay there looking up at the stars. How quiet everything was! Jacob saw the stars twinkling in the dark sky. He knew God was up there in Heaven, but he did not know if God was down there in the dark with him or not. God let him know that He was there. God is everywhere. No matter where you go or how long you stay, God is with you all the time. God loves you.\n\nPoor Jacob had walked a long way that day. He was so tired when he lay down that he went right to sleep. While Jacob was sleeping he had a wonderful dream. A dream is something you see or think while you are asleep.\n\nHe dreamed he saw a bright, shiny ladder that was so long that it reached high, high up into the sky. That ladder reached right up to Heaven. Beautiful angels were walking up and down the ladder from Heaven.\n\nAt the very, very tip-top of the ladder was the best of all. God, the heavenly Father, stood there and talked to Jacob.\n\nGod said to Jacob, “I will be with you where ever you go. I am with you and I will keep you safe. I will go with you and I will bring you back home again. I will never leave you.”\n\nWhen Jacob woke up he did not feel lonesome any more. He then knew that God was there with him all the time. He knew God would take care of him there just as He did at home. Jacob must have thought: “I should have known that God is here. Here are the mountains He made. Here is the sunshine to make the day bright and warm; and last night, I saw God’s stars in the dark sky. Yes, God is everywhere.”\n\nJacob wanted to do something to thank God for His love to him after he had that wonderful dream. He took the rock he had used for a pillow and stood it up on one end. Then he poured some oil on top of it. That is the way people used to show their thanks to God a long, long time ago, before Jesus came to teach them how to pray.\n\nJacob was so happy that God had let him know that He was always with him. He told God that if He would go with him to his uncle’s and bring him back home to his mother and father again, he would always love Him and would give God part of what he had.\n\nGod is still watching over His children today and He takes care of them in the dark and in the light. He knows just what you did today and where you went. He knows how you acted and what you said. Did you make God happy today?",

One- two-three-four-five-six-seven-eight-nine-ten. That many. He had one brother who was little, too.\n\nOne day Joseph’s father gave him a very pretty coat. It had so many pretty colors in it. Joseph’s big brothers were not happy because Joseph got that coat. Each brother thought he should be the one to have it.\n\nOne day Joseph’s daddy told him that his big brothers were taking care of the sheep up in the hills, and he wanted Joseph to go and see how they were getting along, to see if everything was all right.\n\nJoseph was glad to do this for his daddy. He put on his beautiful coat with all the colors and started out to walk to the hills. Walk, walk, walk. It was a long way to where his big brothers took care of the sheep.\n\nThe brothers saw him coming. “Here comes Joseph,” they said. They thought, “Father likes him better than he does us. He gave him that beautiful coat.” Those brothers were bad boys and had bad thoughts in their heart to think that.\n\nSome of the brothers were so jealous of Joseph that they even wanted to kill him. His brother Reuben did not want them to hurt Joseph, and he said: “I know what we can do. Let’s put him down in this old well and take his coat away from him.” A well is a deep, deep hole in the ground. Sometimes it has water in it but this well was all dry.",

A dream is something you think when you are asleep. This king did not know what his dream could be about. Someone told him that Joseph could tell him. The king wanted to see Joseph.\n\nThe king told Joseph about his dream. Joseph said that if God would help him he would tell the king what the dream meant.\n\nGod did help Joseph. Joseph said that for seven years they would have all the food they wanted to eat. After that, the next seven years, there would not be very much food so they should be careful to save some while they had plenty.\n\nThe king was so happy with Joseph that he made him ruler over all the land of Egypt. All the people had to do what Joseph said to do. He gave him pretty clothes to wear, just like his own.\n\nJoseph was very, very careful to save food for the people when everything was growing good. He did not want them to be hungry when things would not grow.\n\nFar away, where Joseph’s brothers lived, their food did not grow either. They were getting hungry.\n\nOne day Joseph’s father told his sons to go to Egypt to buy food there. The brothers did not know Joseph lived in Egypt. His father thought his boy Joseph was not living anymore.\n\nThe brothers went to Egypt. What do you think? Joseph saw them there. He knew them right away; but, of course, they did not know him.",

His name was Moses.\n\nNo one else knew about baby Moses. It was a secret. They did not tell anyone about baby Moses. They did not dare. If they did tell that they had him at their house, a mean old king might send someone to take him away. That king did not want any little boy babies to grow up. He was a mean, bad man.\n\nWhen little baby Moses first came to live in the family it was not so hard to keep him quiet so no one would hear him. He was so little, he would sleep like little babies do.\n\nWhen baby Moses got to be a bigger baby, then it really was hard to keep him from making any noise. No doubt they were afraid someone would hear him and tell the king he was in the home.\n\nOne day the mother decided: “Our baby Moses is getting bigger now. It is not safe for him to be here with us in the house any more. We will have to think of some way to get him out of the house and into a safe place.”\n\nMoses’ mother loved God. She must have talked to God every day. She could pray and ask God to tell her what to do with baby Moses so he would be safe. God told her just what to do.\n\nOne day she went down to the river that was near her house and picked some tall, strong grass that grew there. She began to weave it until it looked like a basket. In and out, in and out, went the grass as his mother worked. She was making a basket-boat big enough to put little baby Moses in.",

        "sectionContent": "THERE were some people whom God loved very much. They were called Israelites, just like you are called an American.\n\nThese Israelite people lived in a country where there was a bad, bad king. He made them work and work. They worked so hard they were almost sick. If they did not do as much work as the bad king said to do they were hit and slapped and hurt.\n\nThe king was mean to these Israelites just because they loved God. He did not love God and he did not want anyone else to.\n\nDo you remember Moses, that little baby who was put into a basket-boat in the river and the king’s girl found him? This baby was a big man now. He loved God, too.\n\nGod told Moses to go help these people get away from that mean king. Moses asked the king if the people could go into the wilderness to worship God. The king said, “No!” They could not go because he wanted them to work for him.\n\nGod sent all kinds of trouble to the king’s people until one day the king said that the Israelites could go and take their children and their cattle with them and never come back.\n\nMoses got all the Israelite people together and started to show them the way to a place God had said they could have for their own.\n\nHave you ever been so happy that you felt like singing? That must have been how the Israelite people felt to be getting away from that mean king and all that hard work. They were on their way at last to the Promised Land, the place God had said they could have.\n\nThe bad king got mad then. He wished he had not said that the Israelites could go. He wanted them back. He called all his soldiers. Soldiers are men who fight for their country. These soldiers helped the mean king.\n\nThey hurried real fast, got their horses and chariots ready, and off the soldiers went, as fast as they could go. Chariots are wagons with only two wheels and horses can pull them real fast. The poor Israelite people had to walk all the way, so could not go very fast. Do you think the soldiers will catch them?\n\nThe people of God were camped beside the big waters of a sea. A sea is much bigger and has lots more water than a river. Here they were resting after the long walk.\n\nThey looked up and saw all these soldiers coming after them. They were so afraid. What would they do? They could not swim across all that water. Little boys and girls were there. How could they get them across to the other side?\n\nMoses said, “Don’t be afraid. God will take care of us.” God told Moses to hold out the rod in his hand over the water of that sea. Moses did, and do you know what happened?\n\nWhen Moses held out his hand, God made a strong wind to blow. It blew so hard it pushed all the water away from the bottom of the sea. There was a dry path there for the Israelites to walk across to the other side. The water backed up and stood tall like a wall. Did you ever hear of water standing up tall all by itself? No, you did not. But God made it do it there that day.\n\nQuick, quick, the girls and boys and big people went on that path to the other side. Now they were afraid again. The soldiers were coming after them. The mean king might catch them after all. They came right into the Red Sea and walked on that dry path, too.\n\nMoses told the people that God would take care of them. The Israelite people of God stood there and watched. Closer and closer came the king and all those soldiers, driving their chariots along that dry path. Here they come! Then God made the wheels come off the chariots, and the horses couldn’t pull them.\n\nGod told Moses to hold out his hand again. Moses did. The strong wind stopped blowing. The high wall of water fell down all over the path. The water covered the bad king and all his soldiers. God had taken care of His people. He will take care of you, too, if you need help sometime. Just pray and say, “Jesus, I need You to help me” and He will help you.",

All over the ground were some small, white, round things.\n\n What is it?” wondered all the people. They called it Manna. My, it was good! It tasted sweet, like cookies made with honey.\n\nEvery morning the manna came from Heaven and every morning the people picked up just enough for the family to eat that day.

March! They walked all day long until the boys and girls must have been very tired. They probably hoped it would be time to stop and rest pretty soon. They could not rest just any time they wanted to or they would get left behind.\n\nThe boys and girls were hot and tired. Everyone was hot and tired. They wanted a drink of water. How good a nice, cold drink of water would taste.\n\nAfter a while the people stopped and pitched their tents. The first thing everyone wanted — boys and girls, men and women, and all the animals — was a good, cold drink of water. Water-water-where is some water? They looked — but there was not any water anywhere. Not even one little, tiny drop. No water at all.\n\n“Give us water that we may drink,” the people said to Moses. They did not like it because Moses had brought them here where there was no water.\n\nPoor people! They forgot about God and how He had helped them. They were thirsty, yet forgot to talk to God. Moses did not forget about God. Moses knew God would never let His people be hungry or thirsty.\n\nRight now Moses could see there was not any water. Moses knew God could and would give them water somehow. God helps those who pray and ask for help. Moses prayed to God, “What shall I do?”\n\nGod watches from Heaven every single minute all the time, day and night. He knows the people needed water just as He knows when you need something. God told Moses to take his stick called a rod, and some of the men of the Israelite people with him.\n\nMoses took the men and his rod. He saw a great, big rock. God told Moses to hit that big rock with his rod. Moses lifted his rod. Would water come out of a rock? A big, old rock that was dry? The men were very still. They watched closely. Would water really come?\n\nMoses hit the rock. Did water come? Oh, yes, God said it would and it did. Only God can make water come out of a rock like that.\n\nSplash! Splash! Cool, clear, fresh water just came tumbling out. Lots of it. It ran down the mountain like a little waterfall. All the boys and girls had a nice, cold drink.

Moses had helped them for a long, long time. Now Joshua would help the people go into the Promised Land.\n\nThe rest of the people were in a camp down near the Jordan River. They were going to be so happy to get where they could have a home all their own.\n\nGod told Joshua He would tell him just what to do. Joshua and the people wanted to go over into Jericho, but they first wanted to know what the city was like. They were waiting at the camp for the two men to come back and tell them what they had seen.\n\nThey couldn’t see the city like we can now. In that country there was always a high rock wall all around the city. The only way anyone could go into or come out of the city was through a big gate in that wall. That was why the men hurried so fast through the gate.\n\nInside the city the two men saw lots of houses. They didn’t look like your house. These houses had a real flat, flat roof. Some of the houses were even built on the rock wall around the city.\n\nThis city had a king, too. A king is the man who takes care of things for the whole city. He heard about these two men. Someone told him they were inside the city walls.\n\nThis king had heard about the people of God and how they had walked all the way there. He heard about how God had taken care of them. He was afraid of what these people of God would do.\n\nWhen the two men came into the city they had to find some place to hide quick, before the king could find them. They did not want the king to find them and keep them from going back to tell Joshua about the city.\n\nGod always takes care of people who love Him. They came to the house of a woman who was kind and would help them. Her name was Rahab. She said she would hide them. Where do you suppose they hid? Rahab took the two men up to the flat top of her house. She covered them with some big, tall, heavy grasses called stalks. The men lay very, very still.\n\nHere come the king’s men to look for them. They looked all over but they didn’t find those two men.\n\nWhen the soldiers were gone the two men came out again and talked to this kind woman. They told her about God.\n\nShe said, “I know God is going to let His Israelite people come into this city.” She had heard how God had helped them and even made a big wind blow so they could walk across the sea on a dry path. Then she asked them to be kind to her mother and father and her family. She didn’t want them to be hurt.\n\nThe men couldn’t go out the gate now because soldiers were watching for them there. Rahab knew a good way to get them outside the city wall. Her house was on the wall. She let them down over the side of the wall by a red rope. The men climbed out her window and down the rope. They were safe from the soldiers. God had taken care of them.\n\nThe men told Rahab to hang that same red rope in the window of her house and she woud be safe and all her family.\n\nRahab put the red rope in her window. When the Israelite people marched into the city later on they saw the red rope in the window of Rahab’s house. She nor anyone in her family was hurt.\n\nIt pays to be good and kind.

She did not say it out loud, but God knew what Hannah wanted. Perhaps the tears rolled down her face but she did not make a sound when she prayed. She wanted a little boy so much she could not even talk. It is good to know that you can pray to God inside your heart and He still hears that prayer.\n\nDid God hear Hannah when she did not talk out loud? Oh yes, He surely did! God always knows just what we are thinking when we pray. If it is good for us He will give us what we pray for.\n\nThere was a priest named Eli in the church when Hannah prayed.

        "sectionContent": "GOD knows where all the good people are. He knows where all the bad ones are, too. God knows about every little girl and every little boy that ever lived.\n\nOne time there was a boy who had a good heart and loved God very much. This boy lived in a little town of Bethlehem. His name was David. David’s father’s name was Jesse. He had a big family of boys and he loved them all. David was not as old or as big as the rest of them.\n\nNo doubt David’s father used to tell him many stories about God. Perhaps he told David how God loved all the children and how He would always take good care of him.\n\nDavid did not stay at home all the time. He had to take care of the sheep for his father. Lots of times he would not bring the sheep home at night. Maybe it was too far. David would just sleep out in the hills with the sheep.\n\nDavid was never afraid. He liked to lie down on the ground at night and look up at the stars. He knew that God was up in Heaven and would take care of him. He was not afraid of the dark night because he knew that God never sleeps.\n\nDavid loved God so very much that he used to sing songs to God about the things he saw around him, and how thankful he was for the beautiful world that God had made for His children!\n\nThe sheep must have loved David, too. They felt safe when he was there. David was so good to them. He took them where they could get a nice, cool drink of water. He knew where the best grass was and he always spoke in such a kind voice to them.\n\nIf David ever did stay away from home so long that he would get lonesome, or if he ever was afraid out there all alone in the hills, he knew all he had to do was to pray to God and God would help him. He knew that God was watching over him every minute just as God watches over you.\n\nDid you know that you are never really all by yourself; even when you cannot see or hear anyone, because God has His eyes on you? He is looking right at you all the time. David knew that. David could not see God, either, but he knew He was there.\n\nOne time God told the man of God, named Samuel, to go to David’s home and talk to David’s father, Jesse. Jesse had lots of boys. One-two-three-four-five-six-seven-eight boys. David was number eight.\n\nGod told Samuel that one of these boys in this family was going to be a king. Samuel had to find out which boy it was whom God wanted for king.\n\nDo you remember that little boy who lived in the Temple Church and heard God’s voice? Samuel was that little boy who listened to God and God could tell him what to do. Now Samuel had grown up to be a big man like your daddy. He still talked to God and God talked to him. God was sending Samuel out to choose one of the boys out of Jesse’s big family. God knew He could tell Samuel just which one to choose and Samuel would get the right one for God.\n\nWhen Samuel got to David’s house, David was not home. He was out in the hills taking care of the sheep again. David had to be a brave boy because there were bears and lions and other wild animals in the hills that like to eat little sheep. One time a big bear did come out to get a little lamb and David killed it. He killed a lion once, too, and he did not have any gun. No one knew about a gun, then.\n\nSamuel did not know about David. He saw all the other boys. They were at home and Samuel looked at each one of them. One of David’s brothers was so big and strong and had such a pretty face that Samuel thought surely this would be the one that God would choose for a king.\n\nGod said to Samuel: “No, this is not the one I want for a king, even though he looks as if he would make a good king.” Do you know why God did not choose him? God looked right down into that boy’s heart and He could see sin in there. God could see all the bad things that Samuel could not see.\n\nSamuel was only a man; and a man cannot see way down inside a heart, but God can. He does it all the time. God can look right down inside our heart, too. He knows if we have been naughty and if some sin is in there.\n\nNo matter how pretty a little girl or boy may look on the outside, if there is one little sin-spot in the heart, God does not think he or she looks pretty. Oh, no, He doesn’t. Little boys and girls might look pretty to other people just like David’s brother did to Samuel. People may even tell you how nice you look, but God does not look at your face, or your hair, or new clothes. God looks way down inside your heart and if you have been naughty He sees that sin in there. He knows that you are not pretty at all.\n\nSamuel looked at all those boys. One-two-three-four-five-six-seven. Seven big boys, but God did not choose one of them.",

        "sectionContent": "DAVID was the boy who took care of his father’s sheep way out in the hills all by himself. He loved God very much. He used to sing songs to God while he was out on the hills. He would tell God how much he loved Him by singing to Him. That is why we sing in Sunday School, too. We tell God we love Him.\n\nGod does love to hear the boys and girls sing. If He sees a girl or a boy not even trying to sing in Sunday School it just does not make God very happy. David sang out there in the hills all by himself.\n\nDavid was a shepherd boy so he knew how close a shepherd has to be to his sheep. He has to take care of them all the time, day and night. David wrote a song and called it “The LORD is my shepherd.” He knew, too, how he had to lead his sheep to all the safe places. God would show David where to go, just like David did the little sheep.\n\nDavid said in his song, \"He maketh me to lie down in green pastures.” A pasture is where the grass is nice and green. In the summertime the grass would dry up from the sun so David would have to take his sheep to a nice, green pasture to be sure they had enough to eat and could rest in the cool grass.\n\nDavid did not mean that God made him lie down in that kind of grass. He meant that God always saw that he had what he needed. Everything God gave him was good and made him happy. God took care of him just as David took care of the little baby lambs.\n\nSheep will not drink where the water is moving very fast. They must have a place where the water is quiet. Then they drink and feel so good inside.\n\n“He restoreth my soul,” sang David. David meant that he could pray and feel so good inside his heart. No matter how hard he worked, when he prayed he was all peaceful and happy inside.",

        "sectionContent": "Do you like to look at books? Some books have big pictures that are very pretty. Some books tell animal stories. There are books for just big people to read. Most books are only make-believe. The stories are not about real people, just play-pretend people.\n\nThere is one special Book we have that is the very best Book of all. It has stories for grownup people and boys and girls, too. Every single story in the whole Book is real and true. It is God’s own Book, the Bible.\n\nLong, long ago God gave us the Bible. God told His good helpers what to write. God wanted us to have something to read so we could know how to pray and get the sin taken out of our heart. He wanted to tell us about Heaven, and how to live so we will be ready to go there.\n\nA long, long, long time ago before the Bible was made into a book, the children would hear the stories told to them like you do in Sunday school. Because God had not sent His Bible-Book yet, the boys and girls would try very hard to remember every word. God wants you to sit up big and still, and listen to your teacher at Sunday School, just like these little boys and girls did when they were told about God.\n\nOne time there was a little boy named Josiah, who was a king when he was only eight years old. He loved God and he loved God’s house the Temple Church. The Temple Church was all dirty and dusty when Josiah was told he was the king. That made Josiah feel bad. He knew God felt bad, too. Nobody had gone to church for a long, long time.\n\nEight-year-old King Josiah told some workers to scrub and clean the Temple Church and fix all the holes. While the men were working they found a Book. God’s Book. It had been hidden in a safe place all this long time, but nobody knew where it was. King Josiah was so glad that they had found God’s Book. He told all the people they should mind God. For a long time the people did mind God, until a new king began to tell the people what to do. He did not love God.\n\nIn those days, people did not have paper and pencils as we do. Sometimes they wrote on sheep-skin after the fuzzy wool was taken off and the skin dried. They used scrolls or rolls to put their words on, too.\n\nOne day when Josiah’s son was king, God told a preacher named Jeremiah to take a roll and write a letter to the people. Jeremiah got a man to write down all the words God told Jeremiah to say.\n\nThe king heard about Jeremiah’s having this man write something in a book, so he wanted to hear it. He wanted someone to read it to him.\n\nIt was winter, and it was cold. The king had a nice warm fire in his fireplace. He was in a big, cozy chair by the warm fire. He was ready to hear the man read what Jeremiah had said.\n\nHe listened for a while. He did not like what he heard. Not at all! Why? Because it told how naughty the people were, how they needed to love God again, how they should pray and get the sin cleaned out of their heart.\n\nThe king did not like that. He got so cross! He asked to see that Book. Then he did a terrible thing. He took out his pocket knife. He cut out those pages and threw them right into the fire. He was not going to listen to God.\n\nSome of the men near him tried to get him to stop, but the bad king kept right on cutting out the pages and throwing them into the fire. What a bad, bad terrible thing to do to God’s holy words.\n\nGod saw what that king did and God did not like it. He did not want those words to be lost. God told Jeremiah to get another roll and write them all over again just like they were before. God said He would make that bad king sorry for what he had done. God did, too.\n\nWhat does God see when you have your Bible? God’s Book is a present to us from God. He wants us to take care of it. The next time you have your Bible with you at Sunday school, just remember God is watching to see if you love it and take good care of it. God is watching you.",

        "sectionContent": "ONCE, a long time ago, there was a king with a big name, Nebuchadnezzar. Nebuchadnezzar liked himself very much. He thought there was no one else in all the world who was so great and wonderful as he was. He had built many great buildings in his land and he even had his name put on some of the big stone blocks in the street. He wanted everyone to notice him and his name.\n\nOne time Nebuchadnezzar had a big, big, very tall make-believe god made. He called it an image. It might have been made to look like him. It was made of bright, shiny, yellow gold and was so high it could be seen for a long way. It was as high as a tall building. Just think how it must have sparkled when the sun shone on it.\n\nNebuchadnezzar had this image put up in a big field so there would be nothing to hide it. The field was near the place where the king lived. He did not love God. He just loved himself and wanted all the people to love him best, too.\n\nNebuchadnezzar said that everyone in the whole land had to pray to this make-believe god. He sent men over the country to tell all the king’s helpers to come to the place where the new god was built.\n\nAll the king’s helpers came. There were lots of them and they made a big crowd standing there near the golden image. This was to be the first time the people were to kneel down and say a prayer to this make-believe god that the king had made.\n\nThere were three men who worked for the king who loved the true God with all their hearts — the same God whom we love. They knew it was wrong to kneel down to a make-believe god. They knew that the God in Heaven had said not to bow down before a god that a man made. That is a sin, and these three men did not want to sin. They came that day because the king had sent for them. All the people were standing very quietly and a man who helped the king called out so everyone could hear. “The king says that you must all pray to this god. Some music will play and as soon as you hear the music you must kneel down before it. If you do not kneel and pray to this god, you will be thrown into a furnace with a big fire in it.”\n\nEven if some of the people did not want to kneel before that golden image they were afraid not to, because they did not want the king to throw them into a furnace of fire. They were afraid of him.\n\nThe three men who loved God were not afraid. One was called Shadrach, one Meshach, and one Abednego. They prayed to God in Heaven and they would not pray to any make-believe, false god no matter who said to do it. Even if they were put into a furnace they still would be true to their God. They would not kneel down in front of the golden image.\n\nAll the people were waiting for the music to play so they would know when to kneel. Listen, the orchestra is playing now. That was the signal to kneel, and bow their heads to the image god.\n\nDid everyone bow down? No! The three men who loved God stood straight and tall. Some bad men told the king on them. “They did not kneel and bow, King Nebuchadnezzar. They just stood there.”\n\nMy, how mad the king was. He shouted very loudly for someone to bring those three young men to him right away. He told the three, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, that he would give them one more chance before he would put them into a furnace with a hot fire. He would have the music play again and this time they had better do what he told them to do.\n\nThe three young men said, “Our God can save us. But no matter what happens to us, we will not pray to your god.” They felt as if they would rather die and go to Heaven than to do a big sin such as kneeling down to a man-made god.\n\nThe music was played again but no, the three men still loved their God in Heaven, and tall and straight they stood.\n\nNebuchadnezzar was so mad! He had a fire made in the big furnace. He kept telling his servants to make it hotter and hotter and hotter. Some of the strongest, biggest soldiers in the king’s army came and tied Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego with ropes and then they threw them right into the hot, fiery furnace. The fire was so hot it even burned the soldiers who threw the three young men into the furnace.\n\nThis big furnace had a door so the king could see inside. After a little while he looked in to see what had happened to Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego.\n\nLook! Look! What a surprise! The men were not burning at all. There they were just walking around in the hot fire but not hurt at all. Only the ropes were burned off them. The king was so surprised at what he saw!\n\n“Wait!” The king said, “Did not we put just three men into the fire? I see four men in there now and one of them looks like the Son of God.” It was the Son of God in there with them and they were not one little bit hurt. The fire would have burned them up if God had not taken care of them. But He did.\n\nNow the king knew for sure that the God that Meshach, Shadrach, and Abednego loved was the true God.\n\nOut of the furnace came the three brave young men. They were well and did not even smell of smoke. They were not hurt, not even one little bit. The king said, “Your God has saved you. No other god could do what your God has done.”\n\nKing Nebuchadnezzar told all the people that they must never say anything against the God in Heaven again. That God is the real God.\n\nIf we love Jesus and pray to Him and do not let anyone make us do something God does not like, God will watch over us and take care of us, too.",

These men were going to find some way to get Daniel into trouble so the king would not like him anymore.\n\nDaniel loved God. He did not forget to pray and talk to God three times every day. Even when Daniel was just as big as you are he loved God.\n\nOne day, when Daniel was not very old, soldiers came to his city and took some of the people away, far away from their homes into another country. They took Daniel, too.\n\nDaniel had to leave his home and many friends. He did not want to go but the soldiers made him go. Daniel probably felt bad leaving his home like that, but he knew that God was with him all the time. No matter where those soldiers put him — God was there with him.\n\nThe people in the new land did not love God. They prayed to idols. Idols are make-believe things. There was no Temple Church in this new place where Daniel could go and pray; but Daniel never forgot about God. Daniel would not pray to a make-believe idol. Oh, my no!\n\nDaniel knew which way the Temple Church was from this new land. So, when he would pray he would always turn his face so he would be looking that way, to where the Temple Church was. Maybe he felt like he was in church when he did that.\n\nThese bad men saw Daniel pray three times every day. They saw him look the way the Temple Church was. Now they knew what they would do to be mean to Daniel.\n\nHurry, hurry, these men went to the king and asked him to fix it so that no one in the kingdom could pray to any god for thirty days but to the king. If they would not pray to the king they would be put in the den with the lions.\n\nThe king put his name on their paper which made this a law. The king did not know these bad men wanted to hurt his good helper, Daniel.\n\nDid Daniel quit praying to God? No, he did not! He knew it was a sin to pray to anyone but God. Daniel knelt and prayed three times every day just as he always did. He opened his window that looked toward the Temple Church, too.\n\nTip-toe, tip-toe, sh-sh, these men watched to see what Daniel would do about his praying. They saw Daniel kneel and pray to God. Away they ran to tell the king about Daniel, that Daniel was not minding him. Daniel prayed to his God, and he would have to be put in with the lions.\n\nOh, the king did not want to do that! He really loved Daniel. Daniel was the best helper he had. The king knew Daniel had a good, clean heart. But because the king had signed that paper he had to have Daniel put into the lion’s den.\n\nThat night, Daniel was put into the lion’s den-cage. A big stone was put by the door to the den. There he was, in with the hungry lions. Was he alone? No, God was there with him.\n\nThe king felt so sad! He could not sleep. He thought about Daniel and what the lions might do to him.\n\nWhen morning came the king ran over to the lions’ den-cage. “Daniel, Daniel,” he called. He wanted to know if God kept Daniel safe from the hungry lions. Can’t you hear him say, “Are you all right, Daniel?”\n\nListen, here comes Daniel’s voice, big and strong. “Oh, king . . . my God hath sent his angel, and hath shut the lions’ mouths, that they have not hurt me.”\n\nHow happy the king was to hear Daniel. Now the king knew, too, that Daniel’s God was the true and living God. The king sent out word to all the people that Daniel’s God was the right God and they must all pray to Him.\n\nWhen you pray to God, you are praying to the same God Daniel did. God will always take care of you, too, just as He did Daniel.",

        "sectionContent": "ONE time there was a man so sick he could not walk. He lived in a little town called Capernaum, far across the water. The people there had heard all about Jesus and how He walked from city to city teaching about God and making sick people well. They wished they could see Jesus.\n\nOne happy day Jesus came to the sick man’s town. Jesus was teaching in another house. Oh, how that poor, sick man wanted to see Jesus! The man was so sick and he shook so hard he could not hold his hands still, and someone even had to feed him. How could he get to see Jesus?\n\nThis sick man had some friends. He had one-two-three-four real good friends that came to see him and always tried to help him all they could.\n\nWhen the friends heard about Jesus’ coming to town, they hurried fast to their poor, sick friend’s house. “Jesus is here,” they said, “Jesus is here, the same Jesus who made blind people see and lame men walk. He can help you, too. Jesus can make you well.”\n\n“How can I see Jesus and ask Him to make me well when I cannot even walk to get to the house where He is?” asked the man.\n\nThe four friends looked at their poor, sick friend. They must find some way to take him to see Jesus but how could they do it? They could not just pick him up and carry him; he was too heavy.\n\n“You shall see Jesus,” said one of the friends. “Jesus never has said ‘No’ to anyone who asked Him to heal him, so I know if we can get you where Jesus can see you, He will heal you.”\n\nThe four friends talked together. All of a sudden they had an idea. They thought of just the way to carry their friend. All four of them could help so he would not be too heavy for any one of them, and it would not hurt the sick man either.\n\n“We are going to carry you,” the man’s friends said. “We will each take a corner of your bed, and then we can carry you easily.”\n\nEach of them took a corner of the sick man’s bed-mat and down the street they started with their sick friend. On they went until they came to the house where Jesus was. The house was so full of people they could not get in at the door. There were so many people in that house listening to Jesus teach, there was not room for one more. Four men carrying a poor, sick man would never be able to squeeze in there anywhere.\n\nThe friends would not take their sick friend back home. No, they were close to Jesus and they would find some way to get to Him. What could they do now?\n\nThe houses in that town all had flat roofs on them. They had some steps on the outside wall that went up to the flat roof. “We will carry you up the steps to the flat roof,” the sick man’s friends said. “We have a plan that will get you in to see Jesus.”\n\nUp the steps carefully and slowly went the men with the bed. They did not want to hurt their friend. Soon they were on top of the roof. It was nice and flat up there and no one was in the way, either.\n\nNow they tied a rope on each corner of the bed real tightly so it would not slip. Then, look! Look at what those men are going to do now. They are making a big hole in the roof, a hole big enough to let the bed go down into the room where Jesus was!\n\nThe roof of that house was not made of wood. None of the roofs were. Perhaps it was long, long, thick, heavy tile put together. It made a good, cool roof; it was not hard to make a hole in that place.\n\nWhen the hole was big enough the men lifted up their friend and held his bed right over the hole. Each man held on to the rope on his side, then slowly, slowly, slowly, down, down, down a little more, came the bed-mat with the poor sick man lying on it.\n\nHow surprised the people inside the house were when they saw that man coming down through the hole in the roof! The four friends had let him down right in front of Jesus.\n\nAll the people watched Jesus. What would He do now? Would He make the man well who had been sick for so long? How quiet everyone was.\n\nJesus looked at the sick man; he looked at the sick man’s friends. He knew these friends had faith that Jesus could heal him. Jesus said to the poor sick man, “Son, thy sins be forgiven thee.” He forgave all that man’s naughty sins. Then Jesus said, “Arise, and take up thy bed, and go thy way into thine house.”\n\nDo you know what happened? That man just got right up as well and strong as any man there; he picked up his bed he had been lying on so long, and he walked. He did not shake any more. He was well and strong. Jesus had made him well. He was healed.",

        "sectionContent": "HOW much does God love us? Does He love us even if we have been bad? Oh yes, God loves us all the time. It makes God feel very sad when we get sin-spots in our heart, but He still loves us anyway and wants us to pray and get the sin-spots all cleaned out again. God wants us to tell Him we are sorry for being bad, and He will forgive us.\n\nOne time Jesus told a story about how to forgive someone who does the wrong thing and then says he is sorry.\n\nOnce upon a time a man had two boys. One day the younger one asked his daddy to give him the part of the money that would be his someday. He wanted the money so he could go away from home and do just what he wanted to, and his mother or daddy could not tell him, No, any more.\n\nHis daddy was a good daddy. He gave him the money and told him he could go. Away the boy went down the road, away from home and his family. He must have felt real big and smart to be going away where his mother and daddy could not see what he was doing.\n\nOh my, but that boy did have a good time! He had lots of new friends. He had money to buy whatever he liked. He almost forgot about home and his mother and daddy, until one day — one day something happened!\n\nThat boy looked in his purse and there was not any more money. No more money at all! He would have to find some of these new friends and ask them for something to eat. He did not have any place to sleep. What was he going to do now?\n\nThe people who said they were friends did not like him anymore because he did not have money to buy them things. Now he knew they really were not his friends. It was only the things he bought that they liked, not him.\n\nHe had to go out and look for work, but he could not find any work. Lots of nights he was so hungry but there was not a bite to eat. He just had to go to bed without any dinner.\n\nHis clothes got so old they started to get big holes in them and some torn places. The worst part was being hungry.\n\nOne day a man said he would give the boy some work if he would do it. “I will be glad to do any work,” the hungry boy told the man.\n\n“All right,” said the man, “go out in the field and take care of my pigs.” Feed pigs! That was the work the boy had to do: dirty, grunty pigs. When he fed the pigs he was so hungry he almost ate the pigs’ food. Nobody felt sorry for him. No one gave him anything to eat.\n\nOne day as he was with the pigs, he thought “Why am I out here hungry, and taking care of these old, grunty pigs in this dirty field. I am going home to my daddy. I am going to tell my daddy that I have been bad and that I am sorry; I am so sorry!”\n\nThe boy felt so ashamed of himself. He was not going to ask to live with his daddy in the pretty, big house where he lived with his brother before he went away. No, he was just going to ask if he could work for his daddy. He was hungry and his clothes were all full of holes. He just wanted something to eat and wear.\n\nWalk - walk - walk, down the long, dusty road went the poor, hungry boy. He was going home. What would his daddy say? Would he let him have something to eat? The boy did not know.\n\nMost fathers and mothers love their boys and girls. They never forget them. This boy’s father and mother did not know where he was, but lots of times they would look way down the road and see if he was coming back home.\n\nAt last, one day, the daddy looked down the road, and what did he see? Not a man on horseback with good new clothes, but a lonesome, tired, dirty, hungry boy. The boy was so tired that he looked as if he would fall down.\n\nHe was a long, long way off and he did not look very good, but the daddy knew who it was. Yes, he knew. “IT IS OUR BOY COMING HOME,” he called to the mother, and down the road the daddy ran as fast as he could to meet his boy.\n\nWas the daddy mad? Oh no, he put both of his arms around the boy and kissed him. He took him to the house to get him some good, clean clothes and something to eat. They had a big dinner that night. It was better than a birthday party because the boy had been away so long and now he had come home.\n\nThe daddy did not care if he looked bad. He loved his boy no matter how he looked. They had prayed for him to come home.\n\nThe boy’s brother was mad and would not even go into the house to the dinner. He said he had been a good boy all the time and no one ever gave him a special dinner or treated him like that. The daddy tried to tell him that he loved him just as much; but he had been right there all the time. The older brother did not have much love in his heart for his lost brother.\n\nJesus is just like the kind, loving father in this story. Jesus is always waiting and watching for the boy or girl who had all the sin-spots cleaned out of their heart, but later forgot to pray and go to Sunday school, and then the sin-spots came in again, and made them bad.\n\nJesus is waiting and watching for them to say, “Jesus I am sorry. Please make my heart clean again.” Jesus will take out all the bad, black spots and make that boy or girl happy again. God does not like the bad things you do at all but He still loves you, and wants to have you say you are sorry. He will always listen when you pray.\n\nDid you know that all the angels in Heaven are happy when a little boy or girl prays to get a clean heart again? The Bible tells us that.\n\nIf you have some little sin-spots in your heart let us pray and ask God to take them out right now. Tell Him you are sorry. He is your Heavenly Father, He will hear you.",

        "sectionContent": "ONE day Jesus was very, very busy teaching the people how to love God. Wherever Jesus went many people always came to talk to Him. Jesus was kind and good and helped them if they were in trouble.\n\nOn this day, a big crowd gathered around Jesus. Some of them had walked a long, long way to see and hear Him. They wanted every minute of the time they could have to talk to Jesus because they would have to walk a long way home again.\n\nSome of the mothers and fathers had brought their little boys and girls to see Jesus, too. It was a happy day for those boys and girls. They were going to see Jesus after all. They were going to hear Him talk.\n\nThe friends who were with Jesus tried to keep the people away. They wanted Jesus to have a little time to rest. Jesus saw all those mothers, fathers, boys and girls and He didn’t want to rest. He loved to talk with them.\n\nJesus began to talk. How the children liked His kind, soft voice, but they were just not close enough to see Him very well. Some of the mothers tried to get through the big crowd so the little ones would be closer to Him and could hear and see Him better. Some of the mothers had little babies. They wanted Jesus to bless their little babies.\n\nJesus’ helpers, the disciples, did not like this one little bit. No they did not. They thought Jesus was too busy to bother with children when there was so many big people there. The disciples scolded the mothers and fathers for bringing their children up to Jesus, but Jesus scolded the disciples, His helpers, for trying to push the children out of the way.\n\nJesus loved those little boys and girls. Yes He did. He told His helpers to let all the little children come up to Him who wanted to. They were never to say No, when a little boy or girl wanted to talk to Him. He thought little boys and girls were the sweetest things on earth and some day they will be the sweetest things in Heaven.\n\nJesus stopped talking to the big people and said, “Let the children come here to me.”\n\nThen the big people stepped back and let the little children move in close to Jesus. Oh, how happy the children were! How they loved the kind look Jesus had. Some of them leaned hard against Him. Jesus picked up some of them. Jesus loved them all so much. He reached out and patted them on the head. He blessed them all, every one. All the mothers and fathers were happy that day.\n\nJesus loves you, too, just as much as He loved the children that day, a long time ago.\n\nJesus’ friends liked to hear Him tell all about Heaven. They knew it was such a happy place. Lots of times they would ask questions about Heaven and what it was like.\n\nOne time His friends wanted to know who would be the greatest or best in Heaven. Jesus called a little child over to Him. The friends looked at Jesus. They looked at the little child. They did not know why Jesus had called the child.\n\nJesus put His arms around the little child and told His friends that if they would be as loving and sweet as a little child, they would be sure of going to Heaven, for “of such is the kingdom of heaven” (Matthew 19:14).\n\nChildren can be taught how to pray and ask God to make their heart pure and clean. A little boy or girl knows and believes that God will take all the sin away from their heart. Sometimes big, grown-up people think too much about working to make money, or having pretty clothes or a big house and things like that instead of asking God to give them a clean heart. Little boys and girls don’t care about those things.\n\nJesus said to His friends that those who love God the way a little child does are the greatest in the kingdom of Heaven.\n\nWe cannot see Jesus now. He has gone back into Heaven to be with His Father, God, but Jesus can see us. He still loves the little boys and girls just as much as He did when He was here on earth. He still talks to boys and girls in their hearts. Not out loud like we do. Jesus whispers in the hearts of all of us, little or big, and lets us know what is good and what is bad for us to do. He lets us know when we have done something that makes Him feel bad. He wants us to ask Him to forgive us. To ask to forgive is to tell Jesus we are sorry.\n\nJesus loves every boy and girl all over the world. God made them all. Some may look different from us, have a different colored face and body, but Jesus loves them, too, and wants us to love them. God made them that way because He wanted them that color. They are Jesus’ friends just like we are.\n\nRemember, wherever you go Jesus is with you. He is watching from Heaven and He loves you. He wants you to love Him, too.",

        "sectionContent": "EVERYONE was excited in a little town one day. Many, many people were standing all along the road. What was happening? Jesus was coming to town that day and everyone wanted to be sure and see Him.\n\nJesus had made sick people well, blind people see, lame people walk; and no one else could do these wonderful things. My, but it would be wonderful to be able to be close to Jesus.\n\nSomeone possibly called: “Here He comes! Here comes Jesus!” Jesus was walking along the dusty road. He had walked a long, long way that day. He was probably tired.\n\nIn that town there lived a man who had lots of money. His name was Zacchaeus. Zacchaeus was so short he would never be able to see over the heads of all those people. He was not as tall as the other men and he did want to see what Jesus looked like. What could he do? He tried to look through the big crowd of people but he could not see anything that way either. Zacchaeus did not just go home and say he could not see Jesus. He wanted to see Jesus and he was going to find a way, somehow. What could he do?\n\nZacchaeus looked around to find some way to climb up higher. All at once he saw a sycamore tree. It was near the road where Jesus would have to walk. If he could climb up in that tree and sit on a limb way out over the road he could not only see Jesus but he would be real close to Him, too.\n\nZacchaeus ran on ahead of the crowd. The people were making a lot of noise so he knew Jesus was coming closer. Quickly, the little, short man ran to the tree. Up the tree he climbed as fast as he could. Now he could see Jesus, and Jesus would not know that he was there.\n\nJesus came closer and closer until He stood right under the tree where Zacchaeus was hiding. Zacchaeus could see Jesus. He could see how He looked. All of a sudden Jesus stopped. Yes, Jesus stopped right under Zacchaeus.\n\nJesus just looked right up into that tree at Zacchaeus. He looked at Zacchaeus and said, “Zacchaeus, come down. I am going home with you.” Jesus may not have seen Zacchaeus climb that tree but He knew he was there all the time. No one can hide any place that Jesus cannot find him. Jesus knows just where every boy and every girl, every man and every woman is all the time.\n\nHow surprised Zacchaeus must have been when Jesus looked up at him and called his name. How did Jesus know his name if He had never seen Zacchaeus before? Jesus knows everybody’s name. Jesus knows your name, too. If you could see Jesus today He could call you by name, too.\n\nWhen Jesus called Zacchaeus to come down out of that tree He had such a nice soft, kind voice that Zacchaeus loved Jesus right away. No one had talked to him so kindly for a long, long time.\n\nZacchaeus loved Jesus more every minute. The other people did not like it very much because Jesus was going home with Zacchaeus, but Jesus knew that Zacchaeus’ black heart had been made white, for he told Jesus that he was sorry for all the bad things that he had done. Zacchaeus said he wanted to give back all the things he had taken that did not belong to him. And he was going to give half of everything he had to the poor people.\n\nJesus was so glad to hear Zacchaeus say that, because He knew that the little, short man who had climbed the tree really loved Him. It is a good thing that Zacchaeus did see Jesus that day and listen to Jesus and get his black, sin heart changed into a white, clean heart because Jesus never did come to that city again.\n\nAfter Zacchaeus had met Jesus and loved Him, no doubt he was so different in the way he acted that everyone liked him now. Possibly even the little boys and girls loved Zacchaeus because he was so good to them. Maybe if they did not have a coat he would get them one. If they needed food he would get some for them.\n\nBefore Zacchaeus saw Jesus he took tax money from the people. Zacchaeus was the man who told the people how much money they had to pay and sometimes he would be mean and make them pay too much money, and he may have kept some of the money for himself. That is probably how he got so much more money than anybody else and why he did not have many friends.\n\nNow Zacchaeus was kind to everybody. He gave back all the money he had taken away from them and even gave them more than he took. He did that to show them he was sorry.\n\nJesus’ love in the heart can make a boy or girl or man or woman so different from the naughty person he used to be. Even when little children pray and ask God to help them be good, they become so sweet that everybody loves them.",

        "sectionContent": "A LONG, long time ago the church used to have a special day in the spring when everyone had a big feast or dinner. They called it the Passover Feast. People came from all over the land to the city of Jerusalem where the big church was.\n\nJesus and His helpers wanted to find a place to have this big feast-dinner. Jesus never did have a house all His own.\n\nJesus said to Peter and John, “Go and prepare us the Passover, that we may eat.”\n\nPeter and John did not know where to find a place big enough for Jesus and all His helpers to eat together, but Jesus knew just what to do. Jesus always knows just what to do about everything. They asked Jesus where to go. That is what Jesus wants us to do, too. He wants us to ask Him what to do and He will tell us.\n\nJesus said they should go to the city and there they would see a man carrying a pitcher of water. They should follow him into the house. He would take them to a big room upstairs. There they should get the Passover dinner ready.\n\nOh, how Peter and John did listen hard to Jesus so they would not forget! They went to the city. They found the man with the pitcher. They went to his house as Jesus had said.\n\nIn the evening Jesus and His helpers came to the dinner. Jesus looked all around Him. Here was the table with the food. At the table sat His friends.\n\nOne man there was bad. Oh, so bad! He was not a friend of Jesus any more like he used to be. His name was Judas. He made believe that he liked Jesus and His helpers, but he did not any more. Of course, Jesus knew Judas had a bad heart with sin in it. No one can hide sin from Jesus.\n\nAt the table, Jesus took some of the bread and broke it into pieces. They did not have bread like our bread. Their bread was not fluffy and soft.\n\nJesus took the pieces of bread and blessed them. When Jesus blesses something, He makes a special, loving Jesus prayer about it. Jesus gave each of His disciple-helpers a piece of the bread He had broken. Jesus told them to eat it and always remember Him! He was not going to have another dinner with them.\n\nJesus meant bad Judas was going to tell the mean men, who hated Jesus, to come and get Him. Jesus knew He would be put on the cross soon. Jesus wanted each helper to have a little broken piece of bread, and always remember how He was hurt on the cross, before He died.\n\nThen Jesus took a cup of grape juice and said a Thank You prayer to God for it. He had each man take a little taste of the grape juice. Jesus wanted them to remember that the mean men made the blood come when they hurt Him. He died on the cross so that He could forgive your sin and mine.\n\nJesus wanted us, too, to remember His death on the cross. Every now and then the people who love Jesus will pray in church and then eat a little tiny piece of bread so they will never, never forget how Jesus was put on the cross so that they could have their sin washed away. As the people pray, the grape juice is passed to each one. Each one will take a little sip of it and remember about Jesus on the cross.\n\nThe Bible tells us just how Jesus wants us to never, never forget to love Him. We do not want to be like that bad Judas who just made believe he loved Jesus. Oh my, no!\n\nWhen Jesus and His helpers had finished eating the Passover Feast, Jesus got up from the table and began to wash the helpers’ feet. They wondered why Jesus, the Son of God, was washing their feet.\n\nJesus put a big, long towel around His waist and got down and washed their feet. Peter did not want Jesus to wash his feet; he thought Jesus was too good to do that.\n\nBut Jesus was trying to show Peter and the others some of the things they should do after He went to Heaven. Jesus said, “If I then, your Lord and Master, have washed your feet; ye also ought to wash one another’s feet.” He told them that if they did that, they would be very happy.",

They wanted to go to church in the beautiful Temple Church.\n\nAs they walked slowly along they came to a hill named the Mount of Olives. Lots of olive trees grew there. When they got to the high place on the hill Jesus told two of His helpers about a little town they would see way over there. He said that when the two men walked into that town they would find a little donkey tied up by a door.\n\nJesus knew exactly where to tell them to go and what would happen after they got there. Jesus always knows everything, and where everything is. He knows where you are right now and what you are doing. He knew there was a little donkey there.\n\n“When you get there,” Jesus said, “untie the little donkey and bring him to me. I want to ride him into Jerusalem. If anyone asks you what you are doing, or says anything to you, just tell him that the Lord Jesus needs the little donkey.” “Lord” is another name that Jesus had.\n\nAway went the two men to get the donkey for Jesus. They found it just as Jesus said they would. They untied it and started to go when someone said: “Why did you untie that colt?” The helpers said Jesus wanted it. The man was glad to have Jesus ride on his donkey. The helpers took the donkey to Jesus. Now they all started off for the big city of Jerusalem.\n\nDo you know that no one had ever ridden on that little donkey’s back before? Sometimes it takes a long time to get a horse or a donkey used to having someone on his back. They jump and buck around and try to shake that heavy load off. They do not like the feel of something heavy riding on them.\n\nThis little donkey did not jump or buck. Jesus just sat on his back and the little donkey went quietly along even when children came near him.\n\nLots of daddys, mothers, boys and girls saw Jesus riding along. They were so glad to see Him they would clap their hands, clap-clap-clap. The children started to jump up and down and run around and sing songs to Jesus because they loved Him so, and were so happy to see Him again. Maybe some of these same children Jesus had held on His lap or had made them well when they were sick.\n\nAs Jesus rode along the little boys and girls ran along beside Him. Oh, how they did sing and sing to Jesus to tell Him how much they loved Him. If there were any flowers along the dusty road they might have even picked some flowers to throw in front of Jesus’ donkey to make it look like a flower carpet.\n\nThe palm trees have great big leaves that look like fans. Quickly, some people cut down these palm branches. They used them to wave and wave in front of Jesus to show Him how much they loved Him. They put the palm branches right in the road, too, to make it look pretty.\n\nAll the people were singing. They would say the word, “Hosanna.” That means Praise to Jesus, like we sing, “Praise Him, Praise Him all the little children.”\n\nInto the big city of Jerusalem Jesus rode on that little donkey. The happy children skipped right along beside Him. They were still singing and they may have even been petting the little donkey.\n\nWhen the people in the city heard all that singing, and heard the little boys and girls, they wondered what was going on. Lots of people ran out into the street to see who it was that the girls and boys and big people loved so much. They saw Jesus riding along on the little donkey.\n\n“Who is this man?” they would call. “Who is He?” “This is Jesus,” sang the happy people. “This is Jesus!”\n\nRight up to the beautiful Temple Church rode Jesus. Right along with Jesus went the little children. When Jesus went into the Temple, the boys and girls just went right in with Him. The children did not stop singing praises to Jesus either. They sang, and sang, and sang, because they loved Him so much. It is a good thing they learned their songs so they all could sing.\n\nWhen they all got inside the Temple Church some of the priests did not like the children to sing. They wanted them to be quiet. Jesus heard the singing and He liked it. He just loves to have little boys and girls sing to Him and about Him. He did not tell the children to be still. He let them sing as long as they wanted to.\n\nMaybe boys and girls cannot tell other people about Jesus like big people can, but they can sing songs to Him. At home, too, when they are playing with other children they can sing songs.\n\nWe will all be able to sing to Jesus and see the smile on His face when we get to Heaven. We must all sing His praises here on earth so we will know our songs. Jesus always hears us when we sing to Him and pray to Him. That is how He knows how much we love Him.",

        "sectionContent": "WHEN Jesus was living here on the earth He did many kind things for the people. He made sick people well. He made blind people see. He made bad people good. He held little children on His lap and blessed them. All the people who loved Him knew He was God’s Son and had been sent from Heaven to be their King.\n\nA king is a man who tells all the people what to do. Jesus was not the kind of a king who sat in a beautiful chair and wore a purple robe like most kings do. Jesus was the kind of a king who wanted all the people to love God, and to pray to Him.\n\nThere were some bad people who did not want Jesus to be their King. They did not want to pray to God. They wanted a king, but they did not want Jesus to be their King.\n\nThey told lies about Jesus to all the people who would listen. They took Jesus to a man named Pilate. Pilate listened to the mean men tell lots of lies about Jesus. Jesus talked to Pilate, too. Pilate loved Jesus. He said he could not see anything wrong in what Jesus had done. He did not want anyone to hurt Jesus but the mean men said: “Put Jesus on the cross.” In that place, they put people on a cross if they were bad. Jesus was not bad, but the people who lied about Him were bad.\n\nSoldiers came and got Jesus. They took Him to a hill and put Him on a cross. They put two robbers on crosses, too, one on each side of Jesus. Poor Jesus! They hit Him and made fun of Him, but Jesus did not get mad at them. He prayed for them and asked God to forgive them, even if they were not sorry for what they did. It is hard to be nice to someone who is mean to us or hits us, but Jesus wants us to pray for the ones who are bad to us.\n\nJesus’ friends and His mother stayed by the cross. They felt so sad! Jesus had not done anything wrong. He loved everybody.\n\nJesus loved them so much that He came down from Heaven and was nailed to the cross to save naughty people. He did not have to let the mean men hurt Him, but He was glad to do it to take away our sins. All of us are born with sin in our heart.\n\nAfter Jesus died on the cross, His friends did not want to leave Him there, so a man called Joseph asked Pilate if he could take Jesus with him. Pilate said: “Yes.” Oh, so lovingly they took Him down off the cross and wrapped Him in a clean, soft, white cloth. They put sweet smelling spices in the cloth, too.\n\nInto a beautiful garden they carried Him. It was such a lovely place! In this garden there were some big, big rocks. A little room was cut out of the rocks and Jesus’ friends took Him there.\n\nJesus was laid in that room in a rock tomb. As they left, His friends rolled a big stone in front of the doorway so no one would bother Jesus.\n\nOh, how sad Jesus’ friends felt when they went home that night. They thought they would never see Jesus again. It was on Friday night that Jesus was put in the rock tomb.\n\nSaturday came. No one was supposed to do any work on Saturday or to go anywhere, so no one went into the garden where Jesus was.\n\nEarly on Sunday morning while it was still a little bit dark, some women who loved Jesus very much, started to walk to the garden. They had some sweet smelling spices they wanted to put on Jesus’ body. They wondered about the big stone that was in the doorway of the tomb. How could they move it? Who would roll it away for them?\n\nCloser to the rock tomb they walked. They stopped in surprise. That heavy rock was not in the doorway. The door of the tomb was wide open. There stood a beautiful angel. The ladies were afraid. The angel knew that the ladies were afraid. “Do not be afraid,” said the angel. “I know you came to find Jesus. He is not here. He is alive. Come and see the place where He lay.”\n\nIn they went. They looked and looked but they did not see Jesus. Yes, there lay the clean, white cloth that Joseph had wrapped around Jesus, but Jesus was not there.\n\nHad someone come in and taken Jesus away so they could not find Him? Where had they laid Him?\n\n“Jesus is alive,” said the angel. “Remember, He told you that He must die on the cross and on the third day He would live again. Go and tell His friends that He is alive and they shall see Him this day.”\n\nHow glad they were to know they were going to see Jesus again!\n\nWhen the ladies turned around and started to run to tell everyone the happy news, Jesus stood in front of them — alive! He talked to them. Then they went and told others: “Jesus is alive. He has risen from the dead as He said He would. He is living.”\n\nThey had come to the garden so sad — they went away, oh, so glad!\n\nThis was the first Easter Day",

        "sectionContent": "IT was early, early in the morning. Mary Magdalene was going to the place where Jesus had been put when He was taken down from the cross. Mary had something nice that smelled sweet to put on Jesus. Mary was a special friend of Jesus.\n\nStop! Look! Where is Jesus? The place where Jesus was laid was empty. Jesus was gone! Jesus was not there! Where was He? Who took Him away?\n\nMary looked again into the tomb to be sure, but no — Jesus was really gone. Mary did see two angels there. Mary started to cry because she felt so bad. One angel said, “Woman, why weepest thou?” Mary said, “Because they have taken away my Lord and I know not where they have laid him.”\n\nMary turned around. She felt so sad! She was crying hard. You know what? Jesus was standing right there — right there by Mary. Jesus was alive. Mary was crying so hard she did not know it was Jesus. She thought it was the man who kept the garden nice.\n\nThen Jesus said her name, “Mary.” Mary turned around and looked again. She knew Jesus’ kind voice. It was Jesus! Jesus was right there by her. He was living again just as He said He would. Mary was not crying anymore. She kneeled down by Jesus’ feet and worshipped Him.\n\nJesus surprised some of His other friends that day, too. He walked along the road with two of them. He ate dinner with some of them, too.\n\nTen of Jesus’ helpers — one-two-three-four-five-six-seven-eight-nine-ten helpers were sitting together Easter Sunday night. All of a sudden in came Jesus, without opening a door. He knew where they were just as He knows exactly where you are all the time. His helpers were so surprised they could hardly believe it was really Jesus. They even walked over and touched Him. Yes, it was their dear Jesus, alive and well.\n\nJesus talked to His helper friends a long time that Easter Sunday night. They were so happy to talk to Him again.\n\nWe cannot see Jesus, but we can talk to Him any time we want to and He always hears us. We pray — that is how we talk to Jesus. He wants us to talk to Him every day.",

        "sectionContent": "PETER was a fisherman before Jesus had asked him to be a disciple-helper. During the years that Peter had walked with Jesus, he had not had time to fish. Jesus kept him busy being a fisher of men. But after Jesus was crucified and had risen again, He was not with His disciples all the time, and Peter did not know what to do. So one day he and his friends decided to go fishing again.\n\nThey did not use a hook and line like we do now. They had a big, strong net they let down into the water. They let it down, down, down, way down deep into the water; and then, when they would pull it up, they would catch the fish that were swimming there.\n\nPeter was always a good fisherman. He had always brought home lots of fish, but this time the men fished, and fished, and fished, and they did not catch any fish. What could be the matter? Where were all the fish? Into the water they would throw their great, big, strong net. Back up it would come, empty. No fish again.\n\nAll night long they fished and fished. They were getting tired and hungry now. They felt sad, too, so they started back to the shore. They hated to go home without any fish.\n\nThey had fished all night and now it was early in the morning. As the boat came near the land the men saw Someone standing on the shore. Perhaps it was still a little dark because they could not see who it was.\n\nA kind voice called to them across the water, “Children, have you any meat?” He meant, do you have any fish? “No,” they called back. The Stranger on the shore said, “Put your net out on the right side of the boat. You will find some fish.”\n\nThe fishermen were tired and they could have said, “Oh, we have fished all night. We have done all we could to catch fish and we did not get any. We do not want to fish anymore.” But they did not say that. They did what the Man told them to do. They put the net down into the water again on the right side of the boat. Deep, deep, deep, into the water it went. Down, down, down.\n\nUp, up, they began to pull the net again. My, but the net was so heavy! It was so heavy the men had to pull real, real hard. There must be lots of fish. Yes, the net was so full of fish they had to drag it. They could not lift it.\n\nWho could that Stranger be who had called to them? It was Jesus! When Peter heard that Jesus was on the shore he could not wait for the boat to land. He was so happy to know that Jesus was there that he jumped right into the water so he could get there faster. The rest of the men brought the boat to the shore. The net was so full they had to drag it all the way. There were 153 big fish in the net.\n\nThere on the shore was another surprise for the tired and hungry fishermen. They saw a fire with fish on the coals, and some bread. How good that food looked to them after they had worked so long and so hard! Jesus had made a nice breakfast for them.\n\nJesus told them to come and eat. Jesus knew how hungry they were. He always knows what we need. The men were probably cold and wet from getting all those fish up to the shore. Now they could get dry by the fire. Jesus is always so good to His friends. He was then, and He is now. Just think they had breakfast with Jesus on the seashore that morning!\n\nWe do not know where Jesus got the fish He had already cooked. The men gave Jesus some of their fish from the net, too. Jesus will give us what we need but He wants us to give some of what we have, too. He does not want us to sit and wait for Him to do everything for us. We have to do a little to help Jesus, too.\n\nJesus hears everything we say. He sees everything we do. Those fishermen did not know that Jesus was anywhere around but He was there. He had two surprises for them — the net full of fishes and the nice, hot breakfast all cooked and waiting.\n\nThe disciple-helpers must have been very glad that they obeyed when Jesus said to put the net in again. They were glad they did not say, “No! we are too tired.” They minded Jesus and got the surprise Jesus had for them.\n\nWe never know when Jesus has a nice surprise for us. Let us mind Jesus and pray every day so we will be ready for a surprise when Jesus wants to send it.",

        "sectionContent": "ONE day when Jesus was here on earth He told His disciple-helpers about a place that is very beautiful. No one can even think how beautiful it will be. Do you know where that place is? It is in Heaven. It is up, up, up, way up past the clouds, in God’s Heaven.\n\nJesus said, “I am going away for a little while. You cannot go with me now.” He was going back to Heaven. Jesus was going back to live with God and all the angels, but He promised that some day lie will come again to take His people to be with Him.\n\nJesus was all finished with His work on earth. He had been teaching people how to love God, what they must do so they, too, can go to Heaven. Everyone, every little boy, every little girl, every grown-up person can go to Heaven if he does what Jesus has taught him to do. It is all written in the Bible, just as Jesus said it. We did not see Jesus when He was here, but if we do what He tells in the Bible, we will be ready to go with Him when He comes back to earth again to get us.\n\nJesus’ helpers must have felt sad when He went away. “Oh, what will we do without You?” they may have said. Jesus told them to go back first to the City of Jerusalem and pray. Then they could go and tell others about Jesus. He promised to help them and be with them, even if they could not see Him.\n\nOne day after Jesus had talked to His friends, they walked to a mountain top. As they stood there, Jesus held out His hands and blessed them. All of a sudden Jesus started to go up, up, up. He was going right up in the air, right off the ground; up, up, up, higher and higher. Jesus was going up into Heaven. A big cloud came and hid Jesus in its fluffy whiteness.\n\nJesus’ friends watched. They were so surprised to see Jesus going up like that! Jesus had gone to Heaven to get a place ready for everyone who loves Him, just as He said He would.\n\nLook! Look! Two men all dressed in white came and asked, “Why stand ye gazing [looking] up into heaven? this same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven.”\n\nHurry, hurry! They went back to the big room in the house where Jesus had told them to go and pray. Lots of other people were there to pray, too. Everyone was praying. No one looked around. God does not like it when we kneel to pray and then look around at others.\n\nGod sent His Holy Spirit, because all the people there had clean hearts. Then they were ready to go out and work for Jesus and tell other men, women, boys and girls about Jesus. You can be a little helper for Jesus, too.",

        "sectionContent": "DID you ever see a big gate? A pretty gate? In the city of Jerusalem there was a most beautiful gate. It was near the Temple Church. It was not a little gate. It was so big that it took many men, big men like your daddy, to open it and close it. It was so heavy!\n\nThis gate had a shiny, shiny gold look. It had all kinds of pretty stone-rocks in it. Wouldn’t you like to walk through this gate and go to the Temple Church?\n\nTwo helpers of Jesus were walking to this beautiful gate, Peter and John. They were going into the church. It was in the afternoon.\n\nPeter and John stopped. What did they see? A lame man, a man who could not walk at all. He had to be carried by his friends and put down by the gate. He could not stand on his feet. He would fall down. Poor man! He had to lie there and ask people for money so he could have something to eat. Every day his friends would carry him and put him down by the gate. He did not even know what it felt like to walk, and now he was a big man.\n\nPeople were coming into the church. They saw this man all the time. Some of the people gave him money. Peter and John saw the man, too. They stopped and looked at him and talked to him.\n\nAt first, when the man looked at Peter, he thought: Maybe this man will give me some money. Peter told the man he did not have any money to give him. Peter did something much better than give him money.\n\nPeter looked at the man. The man looked at Peter. Peter said that he had no money but he had something better. He said, “In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk.”\n\nJust think of that! Peter reached out and took hold of the lame man’s right hand and helped him stand up. The man’s feet got strong. His ankles got strong. He stood all by himself for the very first time in all his life.\n\nThe man could hardly believe he was well. He walked and then he ran. Yes, he was healed! He was well! How happy he was! He started to praise and thank God for making him well.\n\nHe had never walked into the Temple Church. Now he walked with Peter and John right into the church. He did not have to be carried by his friends any more. He did not have to ask people for money any more. God had made him well.\n\nOf course all the people had seen this man by the beautiful gate. They knew that he could not walk before but now he was well and strong and walking with Peter and John. Perhaps they turned to listen as he thanked God.\n\nThere is a big, big porch by the Temple Church. Peter and John and the man walked together out on this big, big porch. All the people went out on the porch, too. They stood and looked and looked at the man who used to lie by the gate. They did not know who made him well, but all of a sudden he was well and there he was.\n\nPeter turned around and saw the people standing there. “Why are you looking at us?” Peter said. The people probably thought it was Peter and John who made the man well. Peter did not want them to think that. He wanted them to know that it was God who had done it. Just God, and no one else.\n\nPeter talked to the people. He told them all about Jesus. He told them Jesus was in Heaven now, but when Jesus was in the Temple Church they did not treat Him very nice. Jesus was taken out and put on the cross. They knew about that. Peter told the people that Jesus wanted them to be sorry for the bad things they had done and to pray and ask Jesus to forgive them, so that they could see Jesus in Heaven some day.\n\nJesus wants you to pray, too. You are never too little to pray. Jesus loves the little children. When you get sick or hurt Jesus will make you well. Someone can help you pray like Peter helped the lame man and you will get well.\n\nDo not forget to say “Thank You” to Jesus when He makes you well. Jesus likes to hear you thank Him for the good things He gives you.",

He even tried to have people who did love Jesus put in jail.\n\nOne day Saul heard that Jesus’ friends were teaching in other cities. Oh, but that did make Saul madder than ever.\n\nSaul went to a man called the High Priest and asked if he could go to all these other cities and find Jesus’ friends. He would bring them all back to Jerusalem. He was going to be real mean and bad to them for loving Jesus.\n\nThe High Priest was glad to have Saul go and hunt for Jesus’ friends. He even gave Saul some letters to other people. He told them to help Saul find Jesus’ friends. Saul really thought he was doing something good. He just did not know that Jesus was his best Friend, nor did he know that Jesus was the Son of God.\n\nHe took the letters and started out. He had to go a long, long way.\n\nThis was after Jesus had gone to Heaven but He knew what Saul was doing. Jesus felt very sad because Saul was acting like this. He probably thought that Saul was too good a man to act like that. He used his lips to say mean things about Jesus. He used his eyes to find bad things to do. What a good, good helper Saul would be for Jesus if he would only use his lips to tell people that Jesus loves them!\n\nOn and on Saul and his friends went. They were getting close to a city now. It was called Damascus. All of a sudden they stopped.\n\nA bright, bright light came down from the sky. That bright light shone right on Saul. He fell down on the ground. Something else came, too. A Voice talked right out of Heaven and said, “Saul, Saul, why are you being so bad to me?” You know who talked? Yes, it was Jesus.\n\nSaul was so surprised! He might have been afraid, too. He really did think he was doing the right thing by being mean to Jesus’ friends. Somebody at school had taught him all wrong about Jesus.\n\nSaul cried out loud, “Who are you, Lord?” and Jesus said to Saul, “I am Jesus.” From the things Jesus said to him, Saul now believed that Jesus was the Son of God.\n\nReal quick Saul began to think how bad he had been to anyone who loved Jesus. Saul felt so sorry! He was sorry for every bad thing he had done. Saul asked Jesus what He wanted him to do.\n\nJesus told Saul to go on into the city and then he would know what to do. Saul’s friends were surprised, too. They had seen that bright light and heard Jesus talking from Heaven right out loud to Saul.\n\nSaul got up off the ground. He opened his eyes. Oh, my, he could not see! He was blind. He could not see at all.\n\nSaul’s friends had to lead him by the hand. They went into the city leading blind Saul. They took him to a man’s house and left him there.\n\nOne day went by. Saul could not see. Two days went by. Still Saul could not see. He did not eat anything. He did not drink anything. Saul just sat there blind.\n\nSaul thought about how very, very mean and bad he had been. Three days and Saul was still blind. Saul began to pray. Jesus helps us when we pray. He hears us. Jesus heard Saul and He knew Saul was sorry.\n\nA man came to talk to Saul. He said, “Jesus told me to come here and pray for you so you may see again.”\n\nThe man put his hands on Saul’s eyes and prayed. When he took his hands away, Saul opened his eyes. He could see! He could see! He was not blind any more. How good it was to see again.\n\nJesus gave me my eyes, thought Saul. He gave me my lips to speak. Now I am going to be Jesus’ helper. I am going to use my lips to tell everyone to love Jesus.\n\nThat is just what Saul did. He told many, many people about Jesus, God’s Son. Jesus had given him a clean heart. He even gave him a new name. He called him Paul after that. Not Saul anymore.\n\nJesus gave you your lips to sing for Jesus. He gave you a tongue to tell other boys and girls about Jesus. Do you use them for Jesus?",

        "sectionContent": "THERE was once a good man who lived in a country far away. He worked for the Queen. He took care of her money and special things. A queen is like a king. She is a lady who tells many people what to do in her country.\n\nThis man wanted to learn about God but there was no church where he lived. He had been to the city of Jerusalem where the Temple Church was. Now he was on his way home.\n\nThis man was riding in a chariot. It is a wagon with two wheels instead of four wheels, and horses pull the chariots. It is not heavy like a wagon, so it is easy to pull.\n\nGod was looking down from Heaven. He saw this good man who wanted to learn more about God. God sent an angel down to talk to Philip who was one of God’s helpers. He went all around the country telling people about Jesus.\n\nThe angel told Philip to go along the road until he met a man he did not know. The man would be riding in a chariot.\n\nThis is just what happened, too. The good man was riding along on his way home from the Temple in Jerusalem. While he was riding he took out his Bible. He began to read about Jesus, but did not understand what he read.\n\nPhilip was walking along this dusty road. Then he saw the man in the chariot reading his Bible. God told Phillip to go over and talk to the man. Philip hurried right over. He was so quick to do anything God asked him to do.\n\nThe man was reading. Philip said, “Do you understand what you are reading?”\n\n“No, I don’t,” said the man. He wished someone would teach him what the Bible was saying. He asked Phillip to come and sit with him. Philip got up into the chariot and sat down by the man. Here they were way out in a hot country, no houses, no people, no stores. No one but just these two men! God knew where to tell Philip to go to find the man who wanted to learn about Jesus. God knows where every one is all the time. He even knows what we are doing. He knows what we are thinking.\n\nThis good man did not know one thing about Jesus. So Philip began to tell him all about Jesus. He told him how Jesus loved him; how he could have the sin taken out of his heart by praying and telling God he was sorry for any bad things he had ever done.\n\nThe man believed everything Philip told him about Jesus’ love. He listened and listened to Philip.\n\nTrot, trot, trot went the horses pulling the chariot. After a while they came to a pool of water. “See, here is water; is there any reason I can’t be baptized in this water?” Philip said he could be baptized if he believed with all his heart.\n\n“I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God,” said the man. The chariot stopped. Out got Philip and the good man. They walked down into the water. Philip baptized the man.\n\nWay out there in that lonely country God saw a man who really wanted to have a clean heart. Right away God sent someone to tell him about Jesus. God sent Philip.\n\nAs soon as the two men came up out of the water the good man looked and Philip was not there. He was gone. He was not walking down the road. He was not by the pool. He was gone. God had moved Philip to another place to preach. God took Philip away and the good man never saw him again.\n\nWhere people live makes no difference to God. He does not care what color their hair is. He does not care what color their skin is either. Why? Because God made them the color He wanted them. God wants them all, someday, to live with Him in Heaven. He wants you to live there, too.",

        "sectionContent": "IN the city of Joppa there lived a lady named Tabitha. But almost everyone called her Dorcas. She was a very special lady. She loved Jesus and wanted to do her very best for Him.\n\nOne of the things that Dorcas loved to do was to sew. If someone needed a new coat she would cut the cloth, thread her needle, and sew a beautiful coat for him. She would make dresses for the women and little girls. If she knew that someone was too poor to buy a new coat, she would make one and give it to that person.\n\nDorcas was never too busy to help anyone who needed help. She did those things for people because she loved them with the special love that God gives.\n\nOne day Dorcas became very sick. She was so sick she died! Her friends were so sad. They would miss her very much.\n\nWhen they had laid Dorcas in a special upstairs room, they sent someone to find Peter. He was one of Jesus' disciples and they had heard that he was in a town nearby. They asked him to please come to them. They wanted Peter to be with them at this sad time.\n\nWhen Peter arrived in the city of Joppa he saw many people who were crying. They were Dorcas' friends. When they saw Peter they brought him to the upstairs room so he could see Dorcas. Some of the widow ladies showed Peter a few of the coats and other things that Dorcas had made while she was alive. They wanted Peter to know what a good friend she had been to them.\n\nPeter told all of the people to leave the room so he could be alone with Dorcas. After they had all left the room, Peter got down on his knees and started to pray. He knew that God could do anything, even make a person live again. When he was through praying he turned to Dorcas. Then he called her by her other name and said, \"Tabitha, get up.\"\n\nDorcas opened her eyes, and when she saw Peter she sat up! Peter took her hand and helped her to get out of the bed. Then he called all of the people who were in the house and told them that she was alive again.\n\nEveryone was so excited! They told their other friends about what had happened when Peter came to see Dorcas. Soon everyone in the city of Joppa knew that Dorcas was alive again!\n\nOn that day many people learned to love Jesus. They believed that Jesus can do anything!\n\nThere are still people in the world today who love Jesus as Dorcas did. They want to do kind things for other people. They want everyone to love Jesus. I want to be one of Jesus' helpers. Don't you?",

        "sectionContent": "GOD is everywhere. He sees us all the time. He always knows what we are doing. God takes very special care of the ones who try to be helpers for Him.\n\nOne time God’s helper, Peter, was in a cold, dark prison-jail away from all his friends. Peter had not done anything bad. All he was doing was telling the people about Jesus. That made the king angry at Peter. He did not want the people to know about Jesus, so he had Peter put in jail so he could not talk to anyone.\n\nThat mean king even had chains put on Peter’s hands. He was chained to two guard-men so he could not get away.\n\nPeter’s friends were so sorry that he was in jail. They met together and said, “What can we do to help poor Peter get out of that jail?” “We can pray,” they thought. “Peter is one of God’s good helpers. God will surely hear us and help Peter get out.”\n\nSo the friends of Peter went to a lady’s house named Mary and had a prayer meeting. How hard they did pray! They asked God to take Peter out of the prison-jail.\n\nGod heard Peter’s friends. When God wants to send help from Heaven He sometimes sends an angel. It was nighttime. Peter was asleep, chained to the two men. Suddenly a bright light began to shine in the dark prison-jail. It shone right in there where Peter was. The angel of God reached over and told Peter to get up, quickly.\n\nPeter stood right up. And those heavy chains fell off! Peter’s hands were free once again. The angel told Peter to put on his clothes and sandal-shoes. The angel said: “Follow me.” Peter must have been very much surprised. No one can hurt God’s helper if God says, “Stop it.”\n\nPeter was way, way far inside the prison-jail. He was not near the door and there were men to keep anyone from getting in or out.\n\nPeter followed the angel. They went past one guard-man, then another, and another. Not one of those guard-men woke up. Not one of them saw Peter leave. Not even the two men beside Peter who had chains on them to hold Peter. No, God did not let one of those men see Peter go. No one even tried to stop Peter.\n\nSoon Peter and the angel came to the big, heavy, iron gate that went into the city where Peter’s friends were having the prayer meeting.\n\nThe big, heavy, iron gate was locked, but it began to move open, open, open. Even big, heavy, iron gates cannot hold God’s people when God sends His angel to open them. The iron gates opened for Peter and the angel.\n\nUp through the dark streets went Peter with the angel. Then the angel left Peter and he could not see the angel any more. Now, Peter really knew he had been brought out of prison. He did not have the chains on. He had been so surprised he had thought he might be dreaming, but here he was near his friend’s house.\n\nPeter went to Mary’s house where they were still praying for him. When Peter knocked at the gate a little girl named Rhoda came to see who was there. When Rhoda heard Peter’s voice she was so happy and excited she ran back to the people who were praying and said, “Peter is at the gate! Peter is at the gate!”\n\nThe people in the house told Rhoda that it could not be Peter, because he was in the prison-jail. That was who they were praying for.\n\nPeter knocked and knocked at the gate. When his friends opened the door, they saw that it really was Peter. Oh, how happy they must have been that Jesus had answered their prayers so fast and helped Peter get out of that cold, dark, prison-jail! Peter told them all about how God had sent His angel to help him. He was glad his friends prayed for him.\n\nGod sends us angels, too, but we cannot see the angels. His angels take good care of us. We do not have to see them. We know they are with us because God said so in the Bible.",

        "sectionContent": "IT was in the middle of the night. It was the darkest part of the night when everyone should be asleep. Paul and Silas were not asleep.\n\nPaul and Silas were two good men. They were Jesus’ helpers. They went around telling people about Jesus. Where do you think these two good men were? They were in jail. That is why they could not go to sleep.\n\nPaul and Silas had not done one thing that was bad. They were put in the old, cold prison-jail just because they loved Jesus and told others about Him.\n\nThere they were, way inside the cold prison-jail. Perhaps they were cold, and their feet were tied up so they could not walk. It was dark in there, too. They even had chains on their hands. But that did not keep Paul and Silas from wanting to pray and talk to God. Some of the mean, bad men had hit and hit Paul and Silas until they felt sore, and they hurt all over. That still did not keep them from loving God.\n\nThey began singing some songs to God because they loved Him so much. Paul and Silas sang and sang together and praised God.\n\nOther people in the prison-jail must have heard them singing and thought, my, how can anyone be happy in here?\n\nAll of a sudden the prison walls began to shake. Shake, shake, shake, they went. Those great, big, heavy walls went shake, shake.\n\nLook! Look! The big, big doors, that had locks on them, began to open, open, open. Now the prison-jail doors were wide open and no one had unlocked them. All the men in there could have run away from there if they had wanted to. God had made the ground shake. God made the prison-jail door swing open. And that is not all. The chains around Paul and Silas’ hands fell right off. Their feet were loose, too, and they could walk. God did not want His two good men treated badly like that.\n\nThe keeper man, the man who took care of the prison, woke up. He was afraid. “What shall I do?” he thought. “What shall I do? The doors are open and the men will run away.”\n\nPaul called to him, “We are all here.” Away went the keeper man for a light. He ran into the dark prison room. He looked. Yes, they were all there.\n\nThe keeper man was shaking, he was so afraid. He ran over to Paul and Silas and got down on his knees right in front of them. “What must I do to be saved?” he asked.\n\nPaul and Silas told the prison keeper that he must know in his heart that Jesus is God’s Son. He must love Jesus and tell Him he is sorry for anything he ever did that was bad. That is how he could be saved. The keeper man did love Jesus then.\n\nThe keeper man took Paul and Silas home with him. He did not make them go back into that ugly, dark prison-jail. He took them to his own house and washed their sore arms and legs. He gave them some good food to eat.\n\nPaul and Silas found out that they could be happy in a prison-jail as well as at home. They did not pout or fuss when bad things happened to them. They loved God so much they were happy anyway. God wants us to be like that. We are not to pout or be cranky when we cannot do what we want to do. God wants us to be happy and be a good helper for Him.",

        "sectionContent": "A BIG ship was sailing on the ocean. Paul, one of God’s preachers, was on the ship. He was not having a nice vacation. He was on there with some soldiers who were taking him to another city to put him into a jail.\n\nPaul was good. He loved God. He had not been naughty or done one thing bad. The men who did not love Jesus were being mean to him. They were trying to make him stop telling men, women, boys and girls about Jesus. Paul wanted everyone to know about Jesus’ love no matter what they did to him or how mean they treated him. He preached anyway. Now they were going to put him in jail.\n\nEverything went fine for a while. The water was not bouncy or rough. The wind was blowing just right to make the boat go.\n\nThen a great, big, strong wind started to blow. It blew harder and harder. Pretty soon the ship was rocking and tipping. The big waves and wind rolled the ship just as if it were a little toy boat. The rain came down so hard and so fast the sailors got all wet. They could not make the ship go the right way.\n\nThe sky was black with clouds. They could not see the sun. They could not even see the stars twinkling in the nighttime. The wind made a terrible, howling noise. Paul was not afraid. He prayed. God would take care of him. Paul knew that. God did take care of Paul.\n\nOne night God sent an angel to tell Paul that the ship really would wreck and fall all to pieces but no one would be hurt. That is just what happened.\n\nThe sailors had been so afraid! They had worked so hard to keep the boat from going down into the water that they had not had anything to eat. Paul told them to sit down and eat. God was taking care of them, too.\n\nThe boat got near the land. It could not sail any farther. It broke all to pieces and began to sink down, down, down into the water. Little pieces of boards floated around.\n\nSome of the men started to swim. Some of them held on to the boards from the ship and floated to the shore. They all got to the shore.\n\nSome people lived on that island. They were surprised when they got up early on that rainy, cold morning and looked out at the sea. They saw a ship that was breaking to pieces. They saw men in the water. How those kind people did hurry fast down to the water to help!\n\nThe men from the ship were very tired and wet and cold. The people of the little island, Melita, made a big, big, hot bonfire on the shore. The men were glad to see that fire. They stood all around it to get warm.\n\nHow kind these people of Melita were to Paul and the other men who were with him! The chief man of the island asked them to come over to his house. They stayed there three days. He probably had the men that worked for him fix good meals for them.\n\nPaul heard that this good chief man’s daddy was very sick. Paul probably thought, “I do wish this chief man would let me pray for his daddy. God would make him well. Then all the people on this island would know about the real God.”\n\nPaul did pray for the sick man. He put his hands on him like Jesus said to do in the Bible. God made him well and strong again.\n\nOther sick people were prayed for and got well, too. Paul stayed there for a while until the bad stormy weather was all over. All the people learned about God and how to pray.\n\nPeople treated Paul mean sometimes, but he did not stop telling others about Jesus. Some of our friends might tease us about Jesus or going to Sunday school. Jesus does not want us to stop telling them about Him, either. Maybe they will learn to love Jesus like you do.\n\nYou can be just like Paul — a good helper for Jesus. You can pray for someone who is sick. God will hear you. Maybe it will be your very own prayer that God uses to make them well.",

God made families to love and care for one another. That means each person in every family has a special job to do.\n\nEach year we set aside one certain day to give cards and gifts to a very important person in the family--Mother. We say, \"I love you,\" and give hugs and kisses. Mothers are very special people. What do mothers do that make them so special in each of our lives?\n\nGod's Word tells us some of the things good mothers do. Mothers have a wonderful way of caring for their children. They love each child in a special way. And everything they do for their children is done because of that special love.\n\nMothers are very busy people. Some mothers even have to work at jobs away from their homes. They are tired when they come home at night. But they still want to make their homes a happy place for their children. They do their very best to see that their children are well cared for. They check to make sure the clothes are washed and mended. They cook good food that their children will enjoy. And then they wash the dishes!\n\nMothers give hugs and kisses whenever their children get hurt. They teach their children to be kind and helpful to other people. And mothers will always forgive when their children have been naughty.\n\nGod was so good to include mothers in our families. Children trust their mothers to teach them what is right. And mothers who love God tell their children all about His wonderful love.\n\nThe Bible is full of stories about good mothers. They loved God and taught their children to love Him too. We should thank our mothers that they help us learn the wonderful stories from the Bible. If we listen when our mothers read these stories, we will learn how much Jesus loves us.\n\nIn some of our homes another person may have to take the place of the mother. It might be a grandma, an auntie, or sometimes even the daddy! When that happens, then each of those people becomes the special person on Mother's Day.\n\nWho is the special person in your life this Mother's Day? What are some ways you can show that you are thankful for all she or he does? Ask Jesus to help you share the special love that has been given to you.",

His mother and grandmother loved God and were kind to other people. They wanted Timothy to grow up to love God and to be kind and good. They taught him all about the things that were written in the Bible. He learned about how the world was created by God. He learned all the stories about people like Noah building the ark, and Abraham's promise from God. He listened carefully when they told about Joseph's coat of many colors, Jonah and the whale, and David as a shepherd boy. But best of all they taught him about Jesus.\n\nAnother wonderful thing that they taught Timothy was how to pray. They taught him that it is very important to talk to God.\n\nTimothy saw how his mother and grandmother loved and helped other people. He knew that they loved him and wanted him to love God with all his heart. They were good examples to follow.\n\nWhen Timothy grew up he had a special friend named Paul. Paul was a worker for God. He loved Timothy very much and wanted him to be a worker for God also. One day Paul put his hands on Timothy's head and prayed a special prayer for him. He told him to be a good worker for God and to tell everybody about Jesus. Paul told Timothy he didn't ever have to be afraid because Jesus had given him love and peace.

He was probably very glad that he had listened when his mother and grandmother told him the stories from the Bible.\n\nAren't you glad that you can learn the very same Bible stories that Timothy learned. It is exciting to learn about Jesus and to know that He is a special friend to us. We have mommies and daddies, and grandmas and grandpas, and even Sunday school teachers to tell us of all the wonderful things in the Bible. If we listen real good we will be able to tell others about Jesus.",

        "sectionContent": "IT was Sunday. John was all by himself on a lonely island. An island is some land that has water all around it.\n\nJohn could not get off the island. He had no boat and it was too far to swim to any land. Some men who did not like God had put him way out there, all by himself, with no one to talk to. They thought he would not live out there, but he did. God took care of him.\n\nWhen Jesus was here on earth, John was one of His very best friends. John loved Jesus very, very much and Jesus loved John. The last time Jesus ate supper with His helpers, John leaned up against Jesus. He loved Him so much he wanted to touch Him. No doubt John felt bad because Judas, one of Jesus’ helpers, had let sin get into his heart, and he was not Jesus’ friend any more. How could Judas do such a bad thing? John wanted to do things to please Jesus.\n\nHere sat John on this island. He could see the water of the sea. He could see the rocks. John was thinking about Jesus who had gone up into Heaven.\n\nAs he sat there and looked at the blue sky and saw the white, fluffy clouds he must have thought about God’s loving care. He must have thought how God made the earth, the trees, the grass. God made the sea and the sky.\n\nSuddenly in the quietness, John heard a Voice that sounded like a trumpet-horn. The Voice was beautiful.\n\nJohn looked around to see who spoke in such a loud Voice way out there away from other people. Whom do you think he saw? There stood Jesus. His face was shining bright as the sun. John was not alone after all! Jesus was right there with him.\n\nHe could not see Him all the time but He was with John.\n\nJohn was afraid at first, but Jesus put His right hand upon John and said, “Fear not.” Jesus told John to write down what he saw. Jesus had many things to tell the people of the world, like you and me. He wanted John to write them in His Book, so we could read about them in the Bible today.\n\nJohn was careful to write exactly what Jesus told him. John saw Heaven and he saw what a beautiful place it is. God is waiting there for people who love Him. There is no nighttime in Heaven. It is always bright and beautiful.\n\nJohn was kept on this island by mean people a long, long time. He was there all by himself but he saw many things that had not even happened yet. He put it all down and we can read about it. He wrote the very last Book in the Bible. When you see the very last Book in the Bible, think about John out there on the island writing it for you.\n\nJohn saw a place called the New Jerusalem. He saw twelve gates to the City. Each gate was made of a beautiful stone called a pearl. The street of the City was pure gold. The walls of the City were made of the beautiful rock-stones that are very pretty. The stones upon which the City was built had the name of Jesus’ twelve disciple-helpers written on it. John even saw his name there, too, on one stone. Jesus loved His twelve helpers who left their homes and went with Him to tell others about Jesus. How happy John must have been when he saw the names of all his friends and his own name, too.\n\nJohn did not understand everything he saw. We do not understand everything we read in the Bible, either, but we know what it says is going to happen someday, because Jesus said it would.\n\nYou must be sure to pray every day and keep your heart clean from sin so you can see the City John wrote about. You will get to live there with Jesus, too, and never have to go away from Him. He shall wipe away all tears, and we shall never cry again and never be sick up there.",

It will not grow pretty flowers now, but it will someday.\n\nSomeday, the cross old bears and tigers and lions will be purry and gentle. They will play with boys and girls like puppies and kittens. They will not hurt anyone. All the mean, growly animals will not be cross and growly any more.\n\nWhen? When Jesus comes back to earth to be our leader, our King. Everything will be sweet like Jesus. The Bible tells us all about it. That is how we know. Jesus promised He would come back and be our King.\n\nWhen Jesus is our King all the animals that have to be in cages now, because they are mean, will follow the boys and girls and want to be petted and loved.\n\nA lion sometimes kills sheep, but when Jesus comes to be our King, the lion will eat with the sheep, and sleep with them. They will all like each other.\n\nJesus wants His world to be beautiful. No bad bugs. Rose bushes will not have stickers on them as they do now. The earth will be as a big, big beautiful garden. Trees will grow green and tall. Flowers will be prettier than you ever saw them.\n\nNobody will hurt. Everyone will be well and strong. Blind people who cannot see now will open their eyes and be well. Crippled people will not limp any more. They will run and jump. Jesus will make everything beautiful. He said so in the Bible.\n\nWhen Jesus came to earth the first time some of the people wanted Him to be King then but Jesus said that He will come back some day and then be King.\n\nJesus wants His people to be good and have clean hearts. No sin can be in Jesus’ land when He is King. Jesus had to teach boys and girls and big people how to pray and have the sin all washed away.\n\nWe all want to live with Jesus when He is King of all the earth, don’t we? Jesus loves the boys and girls; that is why He planned it so there would be a long, long, long time when everyone would have a happy time, so happy.\n\nPeople will never be cross with each other, then. Animals will all love the children and play with them, even the bears, tigers, and lions.\n\nBe sure and pray and ask Jesus to make your heart clean and sweet so you will be all ready to live with Him when He is King. He might come today — or tomorrow. Won’t it be fun to have a lion for a pet like a kitten?",

        "sectionContent": "DID you ever look way, way, way up into the blue sky? You can look and look but you never can see the end of that sky.\n\nWay, way up, up, up, farther than anyone can see is Heaven.\n\nThere is a beautiful place in Heaven where God sits. It is called a throne. A throne is a special kind of chair just made for Kings. God is sitting up there on His throne and looking down here over all the earth. He sees all the little birds and He sees the little animals in the woods. He watches every little boy and every little girl all the time. He sees what you do that is good. Then God is happy. He sees what you do that is bad. Then He feels sad.\n\nWho do you think is by this pretty throne? Angels, lots and lots of angels. They sing songs to God and tell Him how much they love Him. We learn to sing songs in Sunday school so we can sing to God from down here. God likes to hear the songs little children sing. That is one way of showing God we love Him.\n\nThere are people up in Heaven, too. There are babies, and little boys and girls up in Heaven. Only the good and kind people who loved God when they lived on earth can be with God in Heaven.\n\nGod wants us to learn stories from the Bible and when we get big enough He wants us to read the Bible. It tells us just what God wants us to do.\n\n“The Book of Life” is in Heaven; and no one can see into that Book. It belongs to God and do you know what is in it? It is a Book which has names of boys and girls and big people in it. There is only one way to get your own name written in God’s Book of Life. Just one way. When a little child prays and asks God to take the sin out of his heart, when he says he is sorry for all the bad things he did and asks God to forgive him, then God will write his name in that big Book.\n\nJust think how wonderful it would be to have your very own name written in God’s special Book way up there in Heaven. Heaven is a happy, happy place. Everyone wants to go there someday, but only the ones who have their names in that Book can go there. No one will ever cry up in Heaven. No one will ever feel bad and hurt anywhere.\n\nSome people think that if God puts their names in that Book of Life, that they do not need to be careful and pray. That is not true. If a boy or a girl or a big man or lady lets one little sin-spot get back into his heart, then God takes that name right out of the Book. If your name is not written there, then you cannot go to Heaven. No one with the littlest sin can go to Heaven. No one with a teeny-tiny sin-spot can have his name in God’s Book. Just saved boys and girls and men and women!\n\nAll the angels in Heaven are so happy when God writes a new name in that special Book of His! Why don’t you pray and ask God to take away any little sin of naughtiness you might have? You will feel so good and clean inside, and just that minute God will smile at you and write your name in His Book, too.",

You might not see a bird’s home unless you find one in a tree or in some bushes. You cannot see a little ant’s home, either. They live way down in the ground.\n\nGod has a home. His home is up, up, up, way up past the blue, blue sky. God’s home is in Heaven.\n\nGod does not have just one house for Himself. The Bible tells us about God’s Heaven. We cannot look up in Heaven and see what God is doing, but we know Jesus is getting a beautiful place ready for us.\n\nSomeday Jesus is going to come back down here and take all the good men, ladies, mothers, fathers, boys and girls right up into Heaven with Him. Then we will see what it is like in Heaven. We will live with God.\n\nGod has a Heavenly City up there. It is called the Holy City. Holy means clean and pure, and only those with a clean heart can go there.\n\nUp in God’s Heavenly city there is a special place for you. Yes, there is! If you love Jesus and are praying, and have your heart all cleaned from sin you can go there someday. God said so.\n\nJesus is up in Heaven right now getting things ready for us. When it is time we will go to Heaven and never, never, never have to come back to this sinful earth again.\n\nOne time God let a good helper of His look into Heaven so he could write it down in a book. That book is the last book in the Bible. God wanted us to know a little bit about what was up there waiting for us. God’s city is more beautiful than anything any of us ever saw.\n\nThe streets in Heaven are not hard, black streets like those we have. They are shiny, shiny gold. Have you ever seen any shiny gold? It is so pretty! Someday you can run and play and walk on golden streets, when you go to Heaven.\n\nYou will not ever fall down and hurt yourself, either. No one ever gets hurt in Heaven. Even if someone could not walk very well down here on earth, when that one gets to Heaven, he will be all well. No one ever cries in Heaven. Not ever.\n\nGod’s city is a big, big city. There is a wall around God’s city. It is real high. It is so pretty. It has all colors and kinds of pretty rocks and stones in it. We do not have any walls like that here.\n\nIn God’s Holy City you will never have to go to bed. Why? Because there is never any night there. You will not get sleepy and tired. No one will need lights or candles, or flashlights because there will never be any dark at all.\n\nBest of all, when you get to Heaven you will see Jesus. He may hold you on His lap just as He did those little boys and girls we are told about in the Bible. Jesus will tell you many things.\n\nAngels are with you all the time here on earth. God sends them to take care of you. You cannot see your angel that stays by you now, but when you get to Heaven you will see the angels.\n\nAll the boys and girls will be singing to Jesus. Are you practicing now every Sunday when all the children sing? Someday you can sing songs to Jesus.\n\nThe people who are bad and have not asked God to take away their sin will not get to go to Heaven. God cannot have any bad hearts up there. No one who took one little thing that did not belong to him can have a place in Heaven unless that one told Jesus he was sorry and took that thing back, or paid for it. Only those whose names are in God’s Book can go to Heaven.\n\nJesus loves you. He is fixing you a place in Heaven right now. What are you doing to make sure you can go there someday?\n\nBe kind to others. Mind your mother and daddy. Never forget to pray. God likes all these things.",

We would not even have a drink if God did not give us the water.\n\nGod made everything for you. He made it so you would be happy. God loves you so much. God wants you to love Him, too. He wants you to say “Thank You, God, for all the good things You give me.”\n\nSometimes you remember to thank your friends or your mother and daddy for the things they give you. You should. That is right, but God feels very, very sad when you never, never say any “Thank You” to Him.\n\nThe day called Thanksgiving Day is a special day when people all over our land all say “Thank You” to God on the same day. Maybe some of these people do not love God and they even forget to say “Thank You” then.\n\nFirst of all we are thankful for Jesus who came to earth from His beautiful home in Heaven to teach us how to pray and love God.\n\nWe thank God for the Bible, God’s own Book. If we did not have the Bible we would not know about Jesus or how to mind God.\n\nWho gives us the sunshine and the rain to make the flowers and the grass grow? God does. Who gives us a good home and someone to take care of us and love us? God does. When you hear a little bird singing, that little bird is singing his own little “Thank You” to God.\n\nGod likes to have us talk to Him and ask for things we need or want. Yes, God likes to have us ask Him for something but He likes to hear a “Thank You,” too.\n\nEvery little and big boy and every little and big girl can do something bigger and better than just saying “Thank You” to God, something God loves to see. You know what it is? You can give God something no one else has but just you. Your heart. No one else but you can give God your heart to love Him and live for Him. That is the present that God loves the very best of all. Even the angels in Heaven are happy and sing when God gets a “Thank You” like that.\n\nThere is another “Thank You” gift to God that each little boy and girl can give. No one else can give that one, either. Every boy and girl can sing songs to God. That is a happy way of telling God “Thank You” like the little birds do. God loves to hear children sing. Yes, He does. Sing in Sunday school and all during the week at home.\n\nThere are many ways you can show God how thankful you are for His goodness to you, ways that just you, by yourself, can make God happy. You can be sweet, and not be cross, in the way you talk to your mother or daddy or brothers and sisters. When someone takes a toy you wanted to play with, you can share that toy and let him play with it first. You are not very thankful to God when you cry or pout or push something over. God gave your toy to you even if it came from the store. God showed somebody how to make it so you could have it. Everything comes from God first of all.\n\nGod loves every person in the world. Is it not wonderful that God loves you, no matter where you live? He likes some of the people to be a different color in their skin. He made them that way, Himself. Some boys and girls have blue eyes, some have brown eyes. Some children have big, round eyes and some slanted, but God loves everyone the same. That is another thing to be the most thankful for. God loves you special, all by yourself.\n\nWe must never forget to say “Thank You” because Jesus has a place in Heaven for us. God wants all the children to pray and talk to Him every day. When you are talking to Jesus, thank Him first. Say, “Thank You, God for all my good things” before you say anything else. That will make God so happy! Thank Him for listening to you all by yourself when you talk to Him. God has lots of people to listen to, but He still hears you alone.\n\n“Thank You, God, on this Thanksgiving Day. I will make every day a Thanksgiving day to You.”",

God was going to take him right up into the sky and on up, up, up into Heaven. Yes, God was going to take Elijah right up into the sky to Heaven that very day. Elijah did not know just what time God was going to do that, but he knew this was the day.\n\nGod loved Elijah so much! God was glad to have had such a good man for His helper. God needs helpers.\n\nElijah might have been very tired from all the work he had done for God. It was time for him to rest. Elijah was an old man now. Elijah had had lots of troubles, but God always took good care of him. Now Elijah was going to live with God pretty soon. He would be rewarded for all he had done for God.\n\nElijah had a good friend and a helper. His name was almost like Elijah’s. It was Elisha. These two men loved each other very much. On this very special day the two friends stayed real close to each other, waiting for the minute when God would come and take Elijah way up in the sky to his happy new home.\n\nGod had told Elijah that he must go to the little city of Bethel that day. Elisha did not let him go alone. He was not going to leave Elijah. So, the two friends walked together to Bethel. There their friends told Elisha about Elijah’s happy promise from God, that he was going to Heaven.\n\nThere were some more friends Elijah wanted to see in another town. He told Elisha he did not have to walk all that long way with him, but Elisha did not want to leave Elijah for one minute. He went everywhere Elijah went and stayed close by him all the time.\n\nElijah asked his good friend Elisha what he could do to make him happy before he went to Heaven. The answer in Elisha’s heart was: “Oh, I want to work for God. I want to do as many good things as you have done and twice more. That is what I want.”\n\nThat was a hard thing he was asking, but Elijah said: “If you see me when God takes me from you up to Heaven, God will give you what you wish.”\n\nOh, how carefully Elisha watched Elijah. That is why he went everywhere Elijah went. That is why he would not leave him for one little minute. He wanted to be with Elijah when God came for him.\n\nElijah and Elisha were walking along together and talking. Suddenly, right out of Heaven came a chariot of fire and horses of fire. They picked up Elijah. Up, up, up in the wind, riding in the beautiful chariot of God’s fire went Elijah up to Heaven. God’s fire did not burn Elijah. God’s fire is not like our fire. It did not hurt Elijah. It just made others know that it really was God who took Elijah away.\n\nJesus is coming to take us to Heaven someday, too. Maybe not like that, but He is going to come back here again and take all the boys and girls and big people who love Him up to Heaven, too. Elijah will be up there. We will see him.\n\nWhen Elijah went up in the chariot to Heaven, Elisha looked up into the sky, and he looked and looked until he could not see Elijah any more.\n\nSomething fell down from the sky to the ground. Elijah had dropped his robe-coat for Elisha. How happy Elisha was to see that robe! He took off his own robe-coat and put on the one Elijah had dropped for him. Now he felt brave and strong like Elijah had been.\n\nGod had given Elisha his wish. He did many, many wonderful things for God just as Elijah had done. If we stay as close to Jesus all the time as Elisha did to Elijah before he went to Heaven we can be Jesus’ helpers. And we will go up into the sky to be with Jesus when He comes for His children.",

And his father's name was Jonathan.\n\nMephibosheth lived in a beautiful home called a palace. He was a happy little boy. After he was born there was a lady whose job it was to take care of just him. She was called his nursemaid.\n\nOne day, when Mephibosheth was just five years old, his father and grandfather died. They had been fighting in a battle. Everyone was so sad. Mephibosheth's nursemaid was afraid that the enemy would try to hurt him too. She picked him up in her arms and was running with him when all of a sudden she fell down. His feet were badly hurt. They were hurt so much that he could never again run and play or even walk like the other children.\n\nBecause his father had died, Mephibosheth was no longer a prince. And since he wasn't a prince he couldn't live in the palace any longer. He didn't feel special anymore. He was so lonely.\n\nThe new king's name was David. He was the same David who had killed the giant, Goliath, so many years before. And Mephibosheth didn't know it, but the new king had been his father's best friend when they were young.\n\nOne day, King David was thinking about his friend, Jonathan. He was sad that Jonathan had died. Since they had not seen each other for many, many years, King David did not know if there was anyone left in Jonathan's family. If there were, he wanted to show them love because He and Jonathan had made a promise to be kind to each other's children. He asked his servant about Jonathan's family and was told about Mephibosheth. King David was so happy to hear that Jonathan had a son. He sent someone to tell Mephibosheth to come and see him at the palace.\n\nMephibosheth couldn't imagine why the king would want to see him. But King David spoke kindly to him and said, \"Don't be afraid, Mephibosheth. Your father was my very best friend. Now he is gone and I want to be your friend. I will give you all the land that once belonged to your grandfather, King Saul. I want you to live near me and eat dinner with me every day.\"\n\nHow excited Mephibosheth was! He wouldn't be lonely anymore. The king was his friend! And he was going to be in the palace again. He felt like a special person once more.\n\nDid you know that you are a very special person too? Jesus made a promise to be your best friend. If you will let Him be your friend, you won't ever have to be lonely.",

        "sectionContent": "LITTLE boys and girls are skipping along the road. Mothers and fathers are walking with them. Where are they going? They all look so happy. They are going to hear Jesus talk to them out on the hill. There they can sit on the nice, green grass and listen to Him.\n\nOn and on the people walk. They meet other boys and girls and big people. Now there are lots and lots of people sitting down waiting for Jesus to talk to them.\n\n“Here is Jesus now!” Everyone is very, very quiet. No one should ever talk in church, even if church meetings are outside.\n\nJesus started talking. How those people did listen. They listened hard; they were so glad to hear Jesus. We should listen just like that in Sunday school when our teacher tells us what Jesus said to those people that day. It is in the Bible so the teacher knows what He said.\n\nJesus said, “God will love and help anyone who will try hard to do what God wants him to do.” He would bless them and make them happy.\n\nGod will love the people in a special way who are kind and loving to each other and try to help each other. God will bless them. To bless means God sends into the heart a warm, happy feeling that only God can give.\n\nGod will bless every little boy and girl and every big man and woman who has a clean heart. God will send a love blessing to the ones who do not cause trouble by saying naughty, mean things to people or about them. God wants His children to be kind and good to one another.\n\nOnce when Jesus was praying, His helpers asked Jesus to teach them how to pray, too. Jesus helped His workers to know what praying meant.\n\nPrayer is talking to God like you would to your mother or daddy. It is telling God what you really want, and it is saying Thank You, too. Sometimes when you pray, you ask Him to help you. God likes to have us ask Him for help. Every time you pray you should thank God for all the good things He has given you.\n\nJesus taught His helpers a prayer to say that day. He did not mean they were to pray just that one prayer. They could pray prayers of their own, but this was a prayer they could all pray together.\n\nThat prayer is in the Bible and you can learn to say it and to pray that way. It is the Lord’s Prayer. Are you glad you can know the same prayer Jesus taught those big helpers of His a long, long time ago?\n\nThe people who pray do not get so worried about things as other people do. To worry means that you do not know what to do about something and you feel unhappy. You are a little bit afraid and are not trusting God to help you. Jesus told the people not ever to worry. If they loved God, everything would always be all right. They did not need to be afraid.\n\nJesus looked at the pretty hillside. It had some bright flowers growing on it. “Look at these flowers,” Jesus said. “Who takes care of them way up here on this hill? See how pretty and strong they are?”\n\nIt is God who has dressed every little flower in such a pretty color. God loves every one of them. He loves you, too. If God will take care of little flowers growing all alone on a high hill, don’t you think God will take care of you, too? Of course He will.\n\nJesus also talked about the birds that fly through the air. He said that they do not plant their food, neither do they have barns full of grain to eat, but that He takes care of them, and feeds them. And yet, He loves His boys and girls and big people much more than He loves His flowers or birds. His people are His children and they can love God, too. A flower can look pretty but it cannot love God. It does not have any heart to love with.\n\nNever forget that God loves you and all the people more than anything else in the whole world.",

His father had sent him to see his three big brothers who were in the army of Israel.\n\nAfter a while David got to the camp where his brothers were. All of a sudden he heard a mean, terribly loud voice coming across a little low place in the land. The voice sounded a little like thunder. Who could be making such a noise as that?\n\nDavid looked down into the low place called a valley. What did he see? He saw a great, great, big, big, big man, bigger than any man he had ever seen. Bigger than any man you ever saw either. He was a giant!\n\nThere that old giant walked up and down, and up and down making fun of God’s people in that army. He yelled as loud as he could, asking for someone to come and fight him. He belonged to the army that did not like God. They wanted to hurt God’s people.\n\nAll the soldier men were afraid of that giant. His name was Goliath. He was so big no one wanted to go down there and make him stop making fun of God’s army.\n\nDavid looked at that giant Goliath. He did not like to hear him talking against God. David was just a boy, not big like his brothers, but he was not one little bit afraid of that giant. Not at all.\n\nDavid was going to go down there and make him stop talking about God’s army like that. He knew that God would help him. Why should he be afraid? God is stronger than anybody.\n\nGod had helped David before. Once when David was taking care of his father’s sheep a lion and a bear had come. David caught that big lion by its beard. God had helped David kill the lion and the bear. God would help him get rid of the giant, too. David knew He would.\n\nDavid’s brothers were mad at David for coming to their army. They did not want David to fight with the giant. It made them feel ashamed, probably, because they were afraid.\n\nSomeone told the king about David. The king told them to go and get David. King Saul said that David was not strong enough to get near the giant. He would be hurt if he went down to fight Goliath. David told the king he knew he was not strong enough by himself, but God was going to help him. God can do what no one else can do. David wanted to fight the giant and make him stop talking against God.\n\nAway went David. He took the long sick he used when he walked on the mountains with the sheep. It is called a staff.\n\nDavid took five smooth rocks from the little brook. A brook is some water that bubbles along. He put the rocks into a little bag he had. He had a thing in his hand to put the rocks in. It was a sling. David knew how to put rocks in the sling, whirl it around over his head, let loose and out would come the rocks fast. They would hit whatever David wanted them to hit.\n\nDown went David to fight that giant. My, but Goliath was mad when he saw just a boy. He was so mad! He said that he would feed David to the birds. “Am I a dog?” David had come to fight with a stick and little rocks like you would fight off a dog.\n\nDavid stood up tall. “I come to thee in the name of the LORD,” said David. He ran right at the giant Goliath. He whirled his sling around his head. Zing! A little stone whizzed through the air. It hit the giant right on the front of his head.\n\nBump! Down went that bragging, mean giant. He fell down dead! He fell flat on his face. God made the rock go so hard and to the right place to get rid of Goliath. When the men with Goliath saw what David had done they were afraid. They ran away and let God’s people alone.\n\nDavid was so sure that God would help him. God did! He will help you too. If you see something that makes you afraid, just ask God to help you like he did David. He will.",

        "sectionContent": "THINGS were not going well in the kingdom of Israel. The king and all the people who lived there worshiped idols instead of the true God. That made God very unhappy. He told His prophet, Elijah, to give King Ahab a message.\n\nGod gave Elijah the power to stand before the king and say, \"There is not going to be any more rain in this land until I say so.\"\n\nNo rain! How could that be? Oh, King Ahab became very angry! He was the king and didn't want anyone else to say what should happen in his kingdom. He was very worried because he knew that without rain everything would become dried up. Without water the plants would die and there would be no food to eat. If it did not rain the rivers and brooks and streams would dry up and there would be no water to drink. The animals needed food and water to live. And what would happen to the people?\n\nGod had known that the message would make King Ahab very angry. He also knew that the king would try to hurt Elijah. But Elijah was not afraid because he knew that God would take care of him. After Elijah had given God's message to the king, God told him to go and hide by a brook called Cherith. It was near the Jordan river.\n\nWhen he arrived at the brook, Elijah found that he had plenty of cold, clear water to drink. But as he looked around him, he could see no food. There were no houses or stores nearby where he could buy food. He was a long way from where any people travel or where children play. But Elijah was not alone. God knew where he was. And God had promised to send food for him. God had told Elijah that the ravens would feed him. Imagine that! How could birds feed a man? How could they carry enough food in their tiny beaks? Elijah did not worry. He believed that God can do anything.\n\nAnd sure enough, every morning and every night the ravens would bring food to Elijah. They brought him bread and meat just as God had promised. God loved Elijah and took good care of him. Elijah was happy that God had given him such a nice place to stay\n\nDid you know that God loves you too? Sometimes you may wonder how God will take care of you but just remember that nothing is too hard for God. He knows everything you need. He will do what is best for you.",

        "sectionContent": "EARLY one morning there was a terrible noise on top of a high mountain. It was on Mt. Carmel.\n\nOnce upon a time the people had climbed up the steep, steep side of this mountain and made an altar up there so they could pray to God. They said they felt nearer to God way up high like that.\n\nNow the altar on Mt. Carmel was all broken down and nobody came up there any more to talk to God. What was all that noise? What were all those people doing up there? No one had prayed up there for a long, long, long time.\n\nElijah was the one who had told all the people to come up there. For a long time Elijah had to hide from a mean king. The king wanted to hurt him just because he loved the real God.\n\nElijah told all the people that they were praying to a make-believe god called Baal. He could not help them. They needed rain for their land but Baal could not hear them. He could not send the rain. Now they were going to see who is the real God, Baal or the God in Heaven.\n\nHere is what they were going to do. They were going to bring two piles of wood. One for the make-believe god, Baal; one for the real God in Heaven. On top of each of the piles of wood they would put an animal cut up as a gift to God. They were to pray for fire to come down from Heaven and burn up the wood and the animal. They would know that the God who sent the fire was the real, true, living God. Elijah said for the people who prayed to Baal to try first.\n\nSuch a noise they did make! A crowd of men were jumping up and down around their altar. They were praying, singing, crying, trying to make Baal send down the fire. Pretty soon they began screaming and cutting themselves so the blood came. They thought if they did that, Baal would feel real sorry for them, and send the fire. These people who prayed to the make-believe god, Baal, cried, begged, called, and did everything they could think of to get Baal to answer them. Baal could not answer. He was not alive. He could not hear them. He could not hear or speak. He was made out of wood. He was an idol.\n\nElijah waited a long time so the people would have a good chance to get their idol-god to send the fire. There were a lot of people calling and praying to Baal. All Israel was there with the four hundred and fifty prophets of Baal. All those people dancing and jumping up and down and screaming made a big noise. Still the idol-god did not help them.\n\nNow it was Elijah’s turn. Just Elijah, all by himself! He was not afraid. He knew he loved a real God who could hear him when he prayed. He knew this God would send the answer right away.\n\n“Come near unto me,” Elijah told them. He wanted them to see what God would do.\n\nThe people all watched Elijah carefully as he took twelve big rocks and made a place to put the wood on top of the rocks. He did it just as God had told him to.\n\nElijah laid the wood on the rock altar. Then he laid the meat of the animal on top of the wood. Elijah was going to do something to make it even harder to make the fire burn. He knew God could do anything. He wanted these people to know that his God was the real God.\n\nAll around the big twelve rocks, Elijah made a deep ditch. “Fill four barrels with water,” he said to the men. “Pour the four barrels of water all over the cut-up pieces of the animal, and the wood.” You use water to put out a fire, not to make one. The men probably thought that his God could not make wet wood burn.\n\nElijah knew just what he was doing when he said to get four more barrels of water and really make the wood and the animal wet. This time it even ran down into the ditch that Elijah had made all around the altar. Now the ground was wet, too.\n\nAll the people stood so quiet and still. They must have thought Elijah was going to get it so wet even God could not send a fire hot enough down from Heaven to burn it.\n\nStill Elijah wanted four more barrels of water. It was poured all over the wood, the pieces of the animal, the rocks and now into the ditch. Everything was sopping wet.\n\nThe people knew there was no fire hidden anywhere in the altar Elijah had made. They watched him build it and then they saw all the water go on it. That was just what Elijah wanted. He wanted to show them how foolish and silly it was to pray to an idol that is not even alive.\n\nElijah walked out all alone by God’s altar, the altar Elijah had built to our heavenly Father. A hush came over all the people. Here was just one man praying to God all by himself and the altar was all wet. Would his God really answer?\n\nOh yes, God heard him. God hears each little boy, each little girl, each man and each woman who prays to Him.\n\nElijah looked up into Heaven. He said, “Lord, God, let these people know today that You are a real God and that I love You. Hear me, oh God, hear me, so all these people may love You, too!”\n\nQuick as lightning the fire of God fell upon the altar. Crack, crackle, pop, burned the wood. The pieces of the animal were quickly burned. Even those twelve big rocks burned up, the fire was so hot. The water in the ditch burned and even the dust. God can do anything. He can even make rocks and water burn.\n\nAll the people just fell right down on their knees and put their faces on the ground, and began to cry: “The LORD, he is the God.” They did not believe in an old idol-god any more. They saw that God was the true and loving God.\n\nElijah was a good helper for God. He was not afraid to tell those people that God was the true God even when he was all alone. He knew God would take care of him.\n\nGod needs helpers today. Would you like to be a helper for God and tell someone else about all the wonderful things that God can do?",

        "sectionContent": "ELISHA was one of God's helpers. He had been a special friend of Elijah's. Elijah had told many people about God, and now Elisha was doing the same thing. He told people that God loved them. Many people had heard about Elisha.\n\nOne day a woman came to Elisha and asked him to help her. She told him that her husband had died and now she her two sons lived alone. She owed a man some money but she had none to pay him. Now that man wanted to take her two sons away from her. He wanted to make them his servants! She asked Elisha, \"What shall I do?\"\n\nElisha asked her, \"What do you have in your house?\"\n\n\"I don't have anything in my house except a pot of oil,\" she said.\n\n\"Go and borrow pots and jars from all your neighbors,\" Elisha said. \"Don't borrow just a few. Borrow all they can give you. Then go into your house with your sons and close the door. Take your one pot of oil and start filling each of the pots and jars that you borrowed.\"\n\nThat sounded like a strange answer to her problem, but the woman and her sons obeyed Elisha right away. She sent her sons to all of their neighbors' houses. At each house, the sons asked if they could borrow all of their empty pots and jars. When the sons were through collecting them from the neighbors, they returned home.\n\nThe woman and her sons went into their house and shut the door. Then she took her pot of oil from the shelf and started to fill one of the borrowed jars. And something wonderful happened! No matter how much oil she poured out, there was still more oil left in her own small pot. As each of the borrowed pots and jars was filled her sons would set it aside. Then she would pour oil into another, and another, and then another. Finally, when she asked for one more pot to fill, her sons told her that there were no more. All the pots and jars were full. She knew this was a miracle.\n\nThe woman then went to find Elisha. She was so excited as she told him what had happened. She wanted to know what she should do next.\n\nElisha told her to go and sell all the oil. When she had done this she would have enough money to pay the man everything that she owed him. Any money that was left over would be for her and her sons to use. They could buy whatever things they needed.\n\nElisha was a good helper for God. And the woman was wise to obey Elisha.",

They used to see him as he walked down the dusty road past their house. They always asked him to come in and eat with them and rest a while.\n\nThey knew Elisha was one of God’s helpers. Perhaps he did not have any home. He walked from one town to another to tell people about God. Poor Elisha must have been hot and tired lots of times but he did not care. He was helping God.\n\nDo you know what the surprise was? It was a nice room for Elisha — all his very own. This lady and her husband had it built right on to their house just for Elisha. Now when Elisha was in their town he would have a room all for himself.\n\nElisha did not know about it. Here he comes! Out runs the lady to meet him! Cannot you hear her calling, “Elisha, Elisha, come with me. I have something to show you”?\n\nUp, up, up the steps they went. She opened the door. Look! A nice room with a bed, a table, a stool, and a candle. Oh! How happy Elisha was with his room.\n\nOne day Elisha was at this lady’s house. He was wondering what he could give her that would show her how thankful he was for the room. Elisha asked’ his helper if he could think of anything.\n\n“I know,” thought his helper, “she has no child.”\n\nElisha told the lady God would send her a little boy. This made the lady so happy that she could not even believe it. Elisha was right! God did give them a baby boy. How they loved him, just as your mother and daddy love you!\n\nThe boy grew bigger and bigger, just as you do. One day he went out in the field with his daddy. His head started to hurt. Oh, how it did hurt! It hurt so badly his daddy had one of the men carry him home to his mother.\n\nMother did all she could for her little boy, but he hurt worse and worse. After a while he just lay real still and quiet. He did not breathe.\n\nCarefully, his mother carried him up to Elisha’s room and laid him on the bed. She knew what to do. She was going to find Elisha to come and pray for him.\n\nWhen she found Elisha she told him all about the boy and how sick he had been in his head. Would he please come and pray for him? Elisha came and walked into his room and closed the door. He saw the sick little boy lying so still on the bed. Elisha prayed. Oh, how he did pray!\n\nHe put his mouth on the little boy’s mouth. He put his hands on the little boy’s hands. He prayed and prayed. Sneeze-sneeze-sneeze went the boy. One-two-three-four-five-six-seven sneezes. He opened his eyes. He was all well again.\n\nOh, how happy and thankful the little boy’s mother was that Elisha had prayed and God had made her boy well.\n\nGod knows how to make sick boys and girls well when they are prayed for.

        "sectionContent": "ONE time there was a little girl who did not live with her mother and daddy. She lived with Captain Naaman and his wife. Captain Naaman was a very smart man. He was the one who told all the soldiers what to do. He had everything he could want to make him happy but Naaman was not happy at all. He felt so sad, oh, so sad and so did Mrs. Naaman.\n\nCaptain Naaman had a bad sickness called leprosy. Leprosy is a very, very bad disease. No one knew how to make people well that had it. Great big sores would come on an arm or a leg and they would hurt. No one in all the land could help Captain Naaman.\n\nCaptain and Mrs. Naaman were probably very good to this little girl. She did the work they wanted her to do. She loved them and did many things to help Mrs. Naaman.\n\nThe little girl found out that Captain Naaman had this bad sickness called leprosy that no one could make well. This little girl knew about God. She knew God could make any sickness well no matter how bad it was.\n\nShe went to Mrs. Naaman and said that she wished Captain Naaman would go to Samaria to the man of God, named Elisha. He would help Naaman get well.\n\nMrs. Naaman told Captain Naaman what the little girl had said. So Naaman and some of his soldiers went to the country about which the little girl had told them. They wanted Elisha to pray for Naaman’s leprosy.\n\nWhen they got to Elisha’s house, he did not come out to talk to Naaman. He just sent one of his helpers out to tell Naaman to go and wash in the Jordan River seven times. Then he would be healed.\n\nNaaman was mad because Elisha told him to do such a thing as that. The Jordan river looked dirty, and Naaman just was not going to get into that muddy water. He wanted to get well without having to do what he was told to do.\n\nThe soldiers asked Captain Naaman to try it and maybe he would be well again. Captain Naaman still did not want to, but finally decided he might as well try it.\n\nCaptain Naaman and his soldiers went down to the river. Slowly, step-step-step, Naaman walked into the water. Step-step-step out a little deeper. Naaman dipped down into the water and up. He looked at himself. No, the bad leper spots were still there. Elisha had told him to dip into the water with his whole body seven times. One-two-three-four-five-six-seven. He had only gone into the water one time.\n\nIt may have been hard for Naaman to go down into that water seven times, but he did it. Down-up, and down-up and down-up again. One-two-three-four-five-six, and the last time, seven. Will the leprosy be all gone? Will Captain Naaman be healed and all well again?\n\nUp came Naaman. He looked at his body. Yes! Yes! He was healed. He was all well. Not one sore spot of leprosy could he see. His skin was all well; and he was clean.\n\nOh, how glad Naaman was that just a little girl had remembered what her own people had taught her about God. How glad she was, too, that she could be a real helper for God and tell Captain and Mrs. Naaman how God can make sick people well.\n\nShe knew how to get the best help. She knew all anyone had to do was to ask God for help.\n\nCaptain Naaman was so happy to be well, he wanted to give Elisha a present for telling him what to do. Elisha would not take any present. He knew and Naaman also knew that it was God who had made the leprosy go away.\n\nThat little girl could have been mad at Captain Naaman for taking her away from her father and mother one time when they had a war, but she was not. She wanted Naaman to be well and happy. She loved God and knew no matter where she went, she could always take God in her heart and work for Him; and so can we.",

        "sectionContent": "ONCE there was a king called Jehoram. His city had high walls all around it like all the other cities in that land. There was a big gate where people could come into the city and go out. The gates were always locked at night. A man stayed by the gate to let the people who lived there in and out.\n\nThe people who lived inside this city were the Israelites, the children of God, whom Moses had helped get away from a mean king. They should be loving God but now they were not.\n\nJehoram, the king, looked around him and saw his people starving. There was nothing to eat and nothing he could do to help them. The little boys and girls were hungry, oh, so hungry! The mothers and daddies were, too. The king and his people were inside the city walls and they could not go out to get anything to eat.\n\nA bad king, with a heart full of sin, had brought many, many soldier-men to fight against the people God had once helped so much. The bad king and his men could not get into the city. The gates were shut tight and the walls were too high. That bad king made a camp right outside the city. He had all the food and water he wanted with him so it did not matter to him how long he camped there.\n\nInside the city, the people had eaten all the food they had. There was no food left at all. How hungry they were. Oh, so hungry!\n\nThen Jehoram got mad. He said that Elisha, a preacher for God, was to blame for all this trouble. The king did not stop to remember that it might be his own fault. He and all his people had forgotten all about God. Some boys and girls always like to say it is someone else who did something wrong when they themselves did it.\n\nJehoram, the king, and some of his men went to see Elisha, the preacher of God. Elisha said, though the people were starving today, tomorrow there would be enough food for everyone. It would be at the gates of the city.\n\nThe man with the king laughed at Elisha. He wondered how such a thing could happen. He had forgotten about what God can do.\n\nGod felt sorry for the hungry people. He made the bad king and his soldier-men outside the city walls think they heard a terrible, big, loud noise. It sounded just like lots and lots of horses and chariots coming right at them. They thought they were going to run over them. This made them so afraid they jumped up and ran away as fast as they could go. They left all their food, clothes, and everything they had.\n\nThere were four lepers, men with big sores all over them, who were by the gate of the city. They were so hungry! They knew there was no food inside the city, so they thought they would go to the bad king’s camp and maybe they would find food there.\n\nQuietly, quietly, that night these four leper men went to the bad king’s camp. They saw the tents. No one was there. Not one soldier-man!\n\nThe four leper men were so excited! They went into the tent and ate and ate and ate all they could hold.\n\nAfter they had eaten all they could they went to another tent and found more food. They thought: “We are being selfish. Here is enough food for all the people inside the city. We should go and tell the king that there is food here and that all the bad soldier-men are gone.”\n\nBack they ran to the city. They told the gate-keeper about what they had seen. He ran to tell the king.\n\nThe king thought perhaps the bad king and his soldier-men were playing a trick on them. Maybe mean men were hiding somewhere and would come back and catch them, and then come into the city. The king sent some of the soldiers to see, and they found that there was enough food for the hungry people just as Elisha had said there would be. God had told him there would be food for them. Again God took care of His people when they needed Him.",

When Josiah got a little older, sixteen years old, he prayed and prayed and asked God to help him be a good king and do the things he should, to help the people love God, too.\n\nJosiah lived in the big city of Jerusalem where there was a great big Temple Church. Josiah went to this Temple Church to pray to God. The Temple Church used to be pretty, a long time ago, but it wasn’t pretty any more.\n\nJosiah felt real sad when he looked around at God’s house and saw how dirty it was and falling to pieces. The beautiful gates were all so broken that they fell down, and the walls had big cracks in them. There were holes in the floor, too. Josiah saw rubbish lying all around. He could see that God’s Temple had not been cleaned for a long, long, long time.\n\nIt was not Josiah’s fault that the Temple Church had not been cleaned for so many years. Before he was king there were other kings who did not love God. They were mean, bad men. Anyone who does not love God gets mean and bad, sometimes.\n\nThese kings did not want the people to pray to God so they put up some make-believe gods called idols; something they had made. They told the people to pray to them. An idol cannot see, cannot hear, cannot talk, so it could not hear the people pray or help them be good. These kings put up lots of idols for the people, and God did not like that at all.\n\nGod loved Josiah and helped him every day. Josiah could not stand to see God’s Holy Temple so dirty and falling down. He knew God did not like it either. Josiah looked around and thought, “I will make this Temple Church all beautiful again, like it used to be, a long time ago. I will get the work started right now.”\n\nJosiah asked some men to start cleaning up the church and fixing all the broken places. My, how the men did work! They cleaned and cleaned and fixed and fixed. They picked up all the rubbish and carried it away.\n\nOne day while some of the men were cleaning, they found a Book. This Book did not look like the books you have at home. They did not have books like yours when Josiah was king. They just had a paper rolled up. That is the way they made a book then.\n\nThe men looked at the Book, and wondered what it said. They gave it to one of the High Priests. He was a man who helped in the church.\n\nThe High Priest opened the Book and my, how surprised he was when he began to read it! It was a Book that had been lost a long, long time ago. It was called the Book of the Law. God had told Moses what to write in that Book. God sent these laws and rules to the people and God wanted them to obey the rules and laws He sent. God still wants us to obey those same rules today, and to do what God said for us to do.\n\nThe High Priest knew that Josiah loved God very much and would be so happy to see the Book. Josiah told a man who worked for him to read it to him. Josiah listened as the man read. Josiah had never heard these rules before. God wanted everyone to love Him the very best; God wanted everyone to pray to Him, and to do what God told them to do. God said in the Book that boys and girls should mind their father and mother, to be kind to everybody and forgive the one who does mean things, not to fight back but to pray for them. God said many things in His Book that He wanted the people to do.\n\nJosiah was glad to hear all these things. Now he knew how to live for God better than before. He wanted all the people to know the rules God made, too, so Josiah told all the people everywhere to come to the Temple. How surprised those people must have been to see the Temple Church all cleaned up and made beautiful.\n\nJosiah told about the Book they had found that had been lost in the Temple for many years. The mean kings who had not loved God had thrown away a lot of God’s holy things that belonged to the House of God, but God did not let them find this Book of the Law. God knew where it was all the time, and He kept it hid until there was a king who loved Him and would take good care of it; then God let the Book be found.\n\nThere were one-two-three-four-five-books in this one roll of paper, and Josiah read them all to the people. When he had finished Josiah said he was going to always love God with all his heart and do what God said for him to do. All the people were glad for God’s laws and rules, too. They said they would pray to God and throw away those make-believe gods.\n\nJosiah was just a little boy when he started to be a king, but God helped him to be a good king. God can talk to a little boy or a little girl. Josiah loved the Lord God and wanted to do the right things. Now God’s Book was found and Josiah could read the things God said to do. Those same five books are in our Bible today for us to read.",

        "sectionContent": "Do you like to look at books? Some books have big pictures that are very pretty. Some books tell animal stories. There are books for just big people to read. Most books are only make-believe. The stories are not about real people, just play-pretend people.\n\nThere is one special Book we have that is the very best Book of all. It has stories for grownup people and boys and girls, too. Every single story in the whole Book is real and true. It is God’s own Book, the Bible.\n\nLong, long ago God gave us the Bible. God told His good helpers what to write. God wanted us to have something to read so we could know how to pray and get the sin taken out of our heart. He wanted to tell us about Heaven, and how to live so we will be ready to go there.\n\nA long, long, long time ago before the Bible was made into a book, the children would hear the stories told to them like you do in Sunday School. Because God had not sent His Bible-Book yet, the boys and girls would try very hard to remember every word. God wants you to sit up big and still, and listen to your teacher at Sunday School, just like these little boys and girls did when they were told about God.\n\nOne time there was a little boy named Josiah, who was a king when he was only eight years old. He loved God and he loved God’s house the Temple Church. The Temple Church was all dirty and dusty when Josiah was told he was the king. That made Josiah feel bad. He knew God felt bad, too. Nobody had gone to church for a long, long time.\n\nEight-year-old King Josiah told some workers to scrub and clean the Temple Church and fix all the holes. While the men were working they found a Book. God’s Book. It had been hidden in a safe place all this long time, but nobody knew where it was. King Josiah was so glad that they had found God’s Book. He told all the people they should mind God. For a long time the people did mind God, until a new king began to tell the people what to do. He did not love God.\n\nIn those days, people did not have paper and pencils as we do. Sometimes they wrote on sheep-skin after the fuzzy wool was taken off and the skin dried. They used scrolls or rolls to put their words on, too.\n\nOne day when Josiah’s son was king, God told a preacher named Jeremiah to take a roll and write a letter to the people. Jeremiah got a man to write down all the words God told Jeremiah to say.\n\nThe king heard about Jeremiah’s having this man write something in a book, so he wanted to hear it. He wanted someone to read it to him.\n\nIt was winter, and it was cold. The king had a nice warm fire in his fireplace. He was in a big, cozy chair by the warm fire. He was ready to hear the man read what Jeremiah had said.\n\nHe listened for a while. He did not like what he heard. Not at all! Why? Because it told how naughty the people were, how they needed to love God again, how they should pray and get the sin cleaned out of their heart.\n\nThe king did not like that. He got so cross! He asked to see that Book. Then he did a terrible thing. He took out his pocket knife. He cut out those pages and threw them right into the fire. He was not going to listen to God.\n\nSome of the men near him tried to get him to stop, but the bad king kept right on cutting out the pages and throwing them into the fire. What a bad, bad terrible thing to do to God’s holy words.\n\nGod saw what that king did and God did not like it. He did not want those words to be lost. God told Jeremiah to get another roll and write them all over again just like they were before. God said He would make that bad king sorry for what he had done. God did, too.\n\nWhat does God see when you have your Bible? God’s Book is a present to us from God. He wants us to take care of it. The next time you have your Bible with you at Sunday school, just remember God is watching to see if you love it and take good care of it. God is watching you.",

        "sectionContent": "ONCE, a long time ago, there was a king with a big name, Nebuchadnezzar. Nebuchadnezzar liked himself very much. He thought there was no one else in all the world who was so great and wonderful as he was. He had built many great buildings in his land and he even had his name put on some of the big stone blocks in the street. He wanted everyone to notice him and his name.\n\nOne time Nebuchadnezzar had a big, big, very tall make-believe god made. He called it an image. It might have been made to look like him. It was made of bright, shiny, yellow gold and was so high it could be seen for a long way. It was as high as a tall building. Just think how it must have sparkled when the sun shone on it.\n\nNebuchadnezzar had this image put up in a big field so there would be nothing to hide it. The field was near the place where the king lived. He did not love God. He just loved himself and wanted all the people to love him best, too.\n\nNebuchadnezzar said that everyone in the whole land had to pray to this make-believe god. He sent men over the country to tell all the king’s helpers to come to the place where the new god was built.\n\nAll the king’s helpers came. There were lots of them and they made a big crowd standing there near the golden image. This was to be the first time the people were to kneel down and say a prayer to this make-believe god that the king had made.\n\nThere were three men who worked for the king who loved the true God with all their hearts — the same God whom we love. They knew it was wrong to kneel down to a make-believe god. They knew that the God in Heaven had said not to bow down before a god that a man made. That is a sin, and these three men did not want to sin. They came that day because the king had sent for them. All the people were standing very quietly and a man who helped the king called out so everyone could hear. “The king says that you must all pray to this god. Some music will play and as soon as you hear the music you must kneel down before it. If you do not kneel and pray to this god, you will be thrown into a furnace with a big fire in it.”\n\nEven if some of the people did not want to kneel before that golden image they were afraid not to, because they did not want the king to throw them into a furnace of fire. They were afraid of him.\n\nThe three men who loved God were not afraid. One was called Shadrach, one Meshach, and one Abednego. They prayed to God in Heaven and they would not pray to any make-believe, false god no matter who said to do it. Even if they were put into a furnace they still would be true to their God. They would not kneel down in front of the golden image.\n\nAll the people were waiting for the music to play so they would know when to kneel. Listen, the orchestra is playing now. That was the signal to kneel, and bow their heads to the image god.\n\nDid everyone bow down? No! The three men who loved God stood straight and tall. Some bad men told the king on them. “They did not kneel and bow, King Nebuchadnezzar. They just stood there.”\n\nMy, how mad the king was. He shouted very loudly for someone to bring those three young men to him right away. He told the three, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, that he would give them one more chance before he would put them into a furnace with a hot fire. He would have the music play again and this time they had better do what he told them to do.\n\nThe three young men said, “Our God can save us. But no matter what happens to us, we will not pray to your god.” They felt as if they would rather die and go to Heaven than to do a big sin such as kneeling down to a man-made god.\n\nThe music was played again but no, the three men still loved their God in Heaven, and tall and straight they stood.\n\nNebuchadnezzar was so mad! He had a fire made in the big furnace. He kept telling his servants to make it hotter and hotter and hotter. Some of the strongest, biggest soldiers in the king’s army came and tied Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego with ropes and then they threw them right into the hot, fiery furnace. The fire was so hot it even burned the soldiers who threw the three young men into the furnace.\n\nThis big furnace had a door so the king could see inside. After a little while he looked in to see what had happened to Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego.\n\nLook! Look! What a surprise! The men were not burning at all. There they were just walking around in the hot fire but not hurt at all. Only the ropes were burned off them. The king was so surprised at what he saw!\n\n“Wait!” The king said, “Did not we put just three men into the fire? I see four men in there now and one of them looks like the Son of God.” It was the Son of God in there with them and they were not one little bit hurt. The fire would have burned them up if God had not taken care of them. But He did.\n\nNow the king knew for sure that the God that Meshach, Shadrach, and Abednego loved was the true God.\n\nOut of the furnace came the three brave young men. They were well and did not even smell of smoke. They were not hurt, not even one little bit. The king said, “Your God has saved you. No other god could do what your God has done.”\n\nKing Nebuchadnezzar told all the people that they must never say anything against the God in Heaven again. That God is the real God.\n\nIf we love Jesus and pray to Him and do not let anyone make us do something God does not like, God will watch over us and take care of us, too.",

        "sectionContent": "DANIEL was in trouble. Yes, he was, but he did not know it.\n\nSome men did not like Daniel. They wanted to do the work the king told Daniel to do. These men were going to find some way to get Daniel into trouble so the king would not like him anymore.\n\nDaniel loved God. He did not forget to pray and talk to God three times every day. Even when Daniel was just as big as you are he loved God.\n\nOne day, when Daniel was not very old, soldiers came to his city and took some of the people away, far away from their homes into another country. They took Daniel, too.\n\nDaniel had to leave his home and many friends. He did not want to go but the soldiers made him go. Daniel probably felt bad leaving his home like that, but he knew that God was with him all the time. No matter where those soldiers put him — God was there with him.\n\nThe people in the new land did not love God. They prayed to idols. Idols are make-believe things. There was no Temple Church in this new place where Daniel could go and pray; but Daniel never forgot about God. Daniel would not pray to a make-believe idol. Oh, my no!\n\nDaniel knew which way the Temple Church was from this new land. So, when he would pray he would always turn his face so he would be looking that way, to where the Temple Church was. Maybe he felt like he was in church when he did that.\n\nThese bad men saw Daniel pray three times every day. They saw him look the way the Temple Church was. Now they knew what they would do to be mean to Daniel.\n\nHurry, hurry, these men went to the king and asked him to fix it so that no one in the kingdom could pray to any god for thirty days but to the king. If they would not pray to the king they would be put in the den with the lions.\n\nThe king put his name on their paper which made this a law. The king did not know these bad men wanted to hurt his good helper, Daniel.\n\nDid Daniel quit praying to God? No, he did not! He knew it was a sin to pray to anyone but God. Daniel knelt and prayed three times every day just as he always did. He opened his window that looked toward the Temple Church, too.\n\nTip-toe, tip-toe, sh-sh, these men watched to see what Daniel would do about his praying. They saw Daniel kneel and pray to God. Away they ran to tell the king about Daniel, that Daniel was not minding him. Daniel prayed to his God, and he would have to be put in with the lions.\n\nOh, the king did not want to do that! He really loved Daniel. Daniel was the best helper he had. The king knew Daniel had a good, clean heart. But because the king had signed that paper he had to have Daniel put into the lion’s den.\n\nThat night, Daniel was put into the lion’s den-cage. A big stone was put by the door to the den. There he was, in with the hungry lions. Was he alone? No, God was there with him.\n\nThe king felt so sad! He could not sleep. He thought about Daniel and what the lions might do to him.\n\nWhen morning came the king ran over to the lions’ den-cage. “Daniel, Daniel,” he called. He wanted to know if God kept Daniel safe from the hungry lions. Can’t you hear him say, “Are you all right, Daniel?”\n\nListen, here comes Daniel’s voice, big and strong. “Oh, king . . . my God hath sent his angel, and hath shut the lions’ mouths, that they have not hurt me.”\n\nHow happy the king was to hear Daniel. Now the king knew, too, that Daniel’s God was the true and living God. The king sent out word to all the people that Daniel’s God was the right God and they must all pray to Him.\n\nWhen you pray to God, you are praying to the same God Daniel did. God will always take care of you, too, just as He did Daniel.",

        "sectionContent": "A LONG, long time ago there lived a man named Jonah. In the country where Jonah lived, there was a big city where there were lots of people who did not love God. They would pray to things called idols. These idols were made out of wood or stone.\n\nBecause these people never prayed to God, or thought about God, they got to be very, very naughty and bad. They had sin in their heart. God saw that, and He did not like it. God would send someone to tell them how to pray and get saved, and how to ask God to make their hearts clean from sin.\n\nIt was Jonah whom God told to go to this bad city of Nineveh. Jonah was to teach the people about the real God. God said to tell them that they were to be good or something awful bad would happen, and they would all die.\n\nWhat do you suppose happened? Do you think Jonah went? No, he did not want to go. He just did not want to mind God at all. He was like some little boys and girls who do not want to mind their mothers and daddies.\n\nJonah did not want to help the people in Nineveh. He did not like them. He thought God was so good and kind that He would let them pray and be saved. Jonah did not like them, so he did not want God to like them, either.\n\nGod loves everybody. If they are bad and do not know how to pray and be good, then God wants someone to teach them about God. God wants to help everybody, but Jonah did not.\n\nNo, Jonah did not want to go to the city of Nineveh. He thought he would just go someplace else. He thought he would run away from God, then God could not find him and make him go.\n\nHe did run away, too. He went to a place where he saw some boats going out into the ocean. One boat was going far away to another city. Jonah paid his money and got on that boat. He went down near the bottom of the boat and went to sleep.\n\nPretty soon the wind began to blow real hard. The waves around the boat got higher and higher and bigger and bigger. The boat was tipped this way and that way by the wind and waves. The big waves in the water washed right up where the sailors were working.\n\nOO-OO-OO OO-OO went the wind. The boat went way over on one side then way over on the other side. The storm was so bad now the sailors thought the boat was going to break all to pieces. They were afraid.\n\nEach man called out loud and prayed hard to his own idol god to help them, but of course their gods did not even hear them. Wood and stone-rock cannot hear anything. That did not do any good.\n\nMaybe the boat was too heavy in the water. The men started throwing some things over the edge of the boat into the water. Maybe that would make the boat quit tipping and bouncing on the high rolling waves. No, that did not help either. Oh my, is the boat going to tip over and sink down, down, down into that deep, deep water?\n\nWhere was Jonah all this time? He was still asleep way down in the bottom of the boat. He did not know about the storm.\n\nThe shipmaster found Jonah asleep down there. He scolded Jonah: “What are you doing sleeping here? Don’t you know that we are in trouble? Get up and pray to your God. Maybe your God will hear you and help us.” They had prayed to their gods, but they could not help them.\n\nHow could Jonah pray to God for help now? He had not minded God. He had hid in the boat so God would not find him. He felt very much ashamed.\n\nNo one can hide from God. Jonah knew that now. God can see everywhere and He knew where Jonah was all the time.\n\nJonah had to tell the sailors why he had run away, and why they were in trouble. It was all because Jonah had been disobedient. What were they to do? “You will just have to throw me into the water and get me out of this boat,” said Jonah. “This trouble is all my fault.”\n\nThe men did not want to do that. They did not want to throw Jonah into that cold, cold, deep water. They tried harder than ever to keep the boat from going down, down, down into the deep water. The waves got bigger and bigger than before. The wind blew harder and harder.\n\n“You will have to throw me off this boat into the water,” said Jonah. “God has made this storm to stop me from running away. If you throw me out the wind will stop and the water will not tip your boat over.”\n\nThe men did not want to do it but they knew what Jonah said must be right. They picked up Jonah and threw him into the water. Splash, splash went poor Jonah into all those big waves.\n\nThe minute Jonah was off the boat the wind did stop. It was so nice and quiet. The big waves quit splashing. The boat did not tip anymore. Everything was as still as it was before the storm.\n\nWhat happened to Jonah? As he fell into the water, a special big fish made by God, swam right up and swallowed him. It swallowed Jonah! God had made that fish and there it was to catch Jonah as he went into the water.\n\nJonah began to pray while inside that fish. It swam around with Jonah inside it. Jonah told God how sorry he was for not minding Him. He wished he had gone to Nineveh like God had told him to do.\n\nJonah was in that fish’s dark stomach for three days. Because Jonah was so sorry and had prayed so hard God did not let him get hurt, and kept him alive.\n\nNow Jonah knew that even if people prayed to idols of wood and stone they still might have kind hearts, and God loved them anyway. They just did not know any better, no one had told them. God loved them so much He wanted someone to teach them how to pray to the real God.\n\nGod let Jonah get out of the big fish’s stomach. One day that fish swam up by some ground and spit Jonah out on the ground. Jonah was safe.\n\nJonah went to the bad city of Nineveh. He told all the people about God and how to pray. The people listened. They told God about how sorry they were for all the mean things they had done. Oh, but they were glad to know there was a God who could really hear them and make them happy. Everyone in the whole city was saved. All the sin, all bad things, were washed out of their hearts.\n\nWhat if no one would have told them about God? God needed Jonah to tell them. He needs you, today.\n\nNo one can ever hide from God. He is looking right at you all the time. Maybe your mother and daddy cannot see what you do, but God does. God wants you to work for Him and be a good helper.",

        "sectionContent": "MARY was a lady who loved God. She talked to God every day and always did just what He wanted her to do.\n\nGod had a wonderful surprise for Mary. God even sent a special angel from Heaven, named Gabriel, to tell Mary all about God’s surprise.\n\nOne day Mary was all by herself. All of a sudden an angel came down right out of Heaven and started talking to Mary. Mary could really see the angel.\n\nMary loved God and she knew all about angels but she was a little bit afraid because it was the first time she could really see an angel and this angel was talking to her.\n\nThe angel said, “Fear not, Mary.” The angel told her that God loved her so much, He was going to let her do something for Him that no other lady in all the world would ever get to do.\n\nGod was going to send her a little Baby Boy from Heaven. Mary was going to be His mother. This little Baby Boy was going to be much like the other little baby boys, but He was God’s very own Son. He was the Son of God and His name was to be Jesus. He would be the most wonderful Baby ever born, and grow up to be the most wonderful Man in all the world. He would do great things for people when He was older. He would heal sick people, make them strong, make blind people to see, cause crippled ones to walk. He also would make bad people become good; save them from sin and make them ready for Heaven. What a wonderful Baby was coming!\n\nOne night Joseph, Mary’s husband, had a dream. He saw an angel when he was asleep. The angel told him also that Mary was to be the mother of God’s Son, Jesus. The angel said, “Thou shalt call his name JESUS: for he shall save his people from their sins.”\n\nMary and Joseph were still waiting for Baby Jesus when they had to take a long trip. They had to go far away to another city.\n\nThey did not have any cars then, so Mary rode on a little donkey and Joseph walked along beside her. It was a long, long way to the city of Bethlehem and Mary got so tired. They were far, far from home.\n\nAt last here they were at the city. It was night. Joseph wanted to find a room so Mary could go to bed and rest. They went to an inn where people stayed when they were away from home. Knock, knock, went Joseph. The man came to the door, but told them that there was no room in the inn.\n\nThe only place they could find to stay was in a barn where there was a manger. Hay is so nice and soft so Joseph took Mary to the little stable. The hay smelled sweet and clean.\n\nThat night, in the stable, God sent the dear little Baby to live with Mary and Joseph. They named Him Jesus. God sent the little Baby Jesus as He had promised, God’s very own Son from Heaven. Mary wrapped God’s Baby Jesus in a soft, warm cloth and laid Him down in the manger to sleep. Jesus was a little Baby just as you were when you first came to your daddy and mother.\n\nThis was Jesus’ birthday. This is why we have Christmas.\n\nJesus had come to the world to live, and to grow up to be a wonderful man. He had come for a very special purpose — He was to be the Savior who would save the people from their sins, just as the angel had said. He saves big people and He also saves little boys and girls, and makes them good and happy, too. What a joy it is to remember His birthday at Christmas time!",

        "sectionContent": "IT was a starry night. The little lambs were sleeping with their mother sheep. The shepherds were standing and sitting around the fire talking softly in the cool night air. It was very quiet and still.\n\nAs the shepherds watched the twinkling stars something wonderful happened. Suddenly, quickly the sky was just filled with a bright, bright light and there was an angel from Heaven. The light was so bright, it perhaps hurt the shepherds’ eyes. It wasn’t like any light they had ever seen before. They had never seen an angel before, either; and they were afraid.\n\nThen the angel talked to the shepherds way out there in the hill near Bethlehem. The angel in the bright light said, “Fear not: for, behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people.”\n\nThe shepherd men stood very still as the angel talked to them. They listened to every word. The angel said that a Baby was born, “You will find the Baby Jesus, and His mother Mary, and Joseph. The Baby is sleeping in the hay in a manger.”\n\nQuickly, again, even before the shepherds could say a word, they heard some beautiful, beautiful music coming from the sky. The whole big sky was filled with more, and more, and more angels. They were singing a beautiful song, “Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men.”\n\nThe singing filled the air. None of the shepherds had ever heard such pretty singing. Only the angels could sing like that.\n\nNow the light began to go away from the sky. It went away just a little more and a little more until the shepherds could hardly see it. The singing and the angels went away, too; the singing got softer and softer until it couldn’t be heard at all. The light was gone. The angels were gone; the music was all gone. It was just as dark and quiet and still as it was before the angels had come. The angels had gone back to Heaven.\n\n“Something wonderful has happened,” said the shepherds to one another. “Let us go and find the Baby Jesus. We will go into the city of Bethlehem and find Him.” He was the Son of God — God’s little Boy.\n\nDown the hillside the shepherds hurried in the cool night. They went along a little road looking for the stable where the Baby Jesus was sleeping.\n\nThere it is. Into the little stable quietly and lovingly went the shepherds. They knelt before the manger where the little Baby Jesus lay. They knelt to show Him how much they loved Him, just as we kneel today when we pray to Jesus. We do it to show Him how much we love Him.\n\nAfter the shepherds had seen the Baby Jesus, they went back to the little lambs and sheep out on the hills near Bethlehem. They always remembered what they saw that night when Jesus was born. They never forgot the beautiful music and the angels from Heaven.\n\nWe are like the shepherds, a little. We don’t take care of any little lambs but we have been told again and again that Jesus is coming to earth. The shepherds knew He was coming someday too, but they didn’t know when. He came as a little Baby then. When Jesus comes back to us He will be the same Jesus. The Baby Jesus grew up and became tall and had a real kind face. He blessed the little children and healed the blind and they could see. He made the sick well and they became strong. The shepherds believed that Jesus would come. He did. We believe that Jesus will come back to get us. He will. We are looking for Him every day, just as they were looking for Him.\n\nThe angels came down from Heaven all of a sudden and talked to the shepherds. Jesus is coming down from Heaven someday, all of a sudden, and He will take all those who love Him and obey Him right into Heaven to live with Him.\n\nWe did not get to go to the stable that day to see little Baby Jesus, but we will see Jesus; when we go to Heaven we will see Mary and Joseph and the shepherds who loved Him.\n\nHow glad the owner of the stable must have felt to have the Baby Jesus come to the stable where the cows and sheep stayed! He did not know that Jesus was coming, but when Mary and Joseph found no other place he made room for them.\n\nJesus’ loving Spirit needs a home on earth today. Jesus’ love cannot live in a house as we do. There is only one place Jesus’ love can live, and that is in a heart. Is Jesus living in your heart?",

        "sectionContent": "MORNING came. This was going to be a happy day for Mary, Joseph, and little Baby Jesus. Jesus was forty days old and He was going to church. It was a long way to the beautiful Temple Church in Jerusalem.\n\nWhen Jesus was a little Baby all the baby boys went to the church when they were forty days old. There in God’s house the mother and father of each little boy would hold their little baby and thank God for giving them a little baby boy to have for their own. Then the father and mother would leave a gift for God in the church to show how happy they were.\n\nMary and Joseph did not have very much money to buy a real big gift so they brought two very pretty birds to give to God in the Temple Church.\n\nThis happy day was a pretty day. The sun came up and warmed the earth. Perhaps Mary and Joseph had to walk to the city of Jerusalem. They did not care. Most people had to walk everywhere they went in those days so they were used to it. Some people rode on donkeys. They walked slowly along. Joseph carried the two pretty birds that they were taking to give to God. Mary carried the Baby. Little Baby Jesus was real little and tiny yet. He was just a little over one month old. He had not been here on earth very long.\n\nThey had walked and walked, and after awhile they saw the big city. Maybe the top of the big Temple Church was so high up in the sky they could even see that. Oh, how happy they were! Now they hurried a little faster. Down this narrow street they went and up that one until they stood in front of God’s Church. How beautiful it looked to them! How quiet they must have felt in their hearts as they looked at it!\n\nEvery boy and every girl has a house where he or she lives. That is their house. God has a house here on earth, too. It is the church. That is God’s house and even if we cannot see Him, God is there in His house. It is not like a house a family has where we can run and play, and jump, and talk any time we want to say something.\n\nGod’s house is a very special place. God wants His little boys and girls to be very quiet in His house. He wants them to be very still so they can learn about Jesus. God wants us to just talk about Him and His Book and learn stories from the Bible. God’s rules are written in the Bible. He tells us how to be good. If we talk, or run in church, God feels very bad.\n\nMary and Joseph knew how to act in God’s house. They went up the steps very softly, just like God was walking right beside them. Into the beautiful Temple Church they went. Inside the door, no one was making any noise, not one noisy sound. Even little Baby Jesus did not cry. He lay very, very still in His mother’s arms. He was not going to be noisy in God’s house.\n\nWhile they were inside the Temple Church, Mary and Joseph met a kind old man who loved little baby boys very much. His name was Simeon. This man was old. He had loved God a long time. When he looked at the Baby which Mary held he knew right away it was God’s Son, the Baby Jesus. God told him in his heart.\n\nSimeon took Baby Jesus in his arms and held Him. Simeon looked at Baby Jesus, then he told Mary and Joseph, that this little Baby Boy was going to grow up to be a good kind Man. He would teach everyone how to be good and to do what God wants them to do. Simeon thanked God for letting him see Baby Jesus. God had let Simeon know that he would get to see God’s Son someday, and here was the Baby Jesus in the Temple Church. Because Simeon loved God so much he even got to hold Baby Jesus.\n\nThere was someone else in the Temple Church that got to see Jesus, too. It was a very old lady named Anna. Anna loved God and did all she could to live just like God wanted her to. God let her see Baby Jesus, too. God told her that Baby Jesus was His Son. How happy Anna was to know this!\n\nAnna was so happy that God had told her that Baby Jesus was His Son that she said, ‘Thank You” to God, for Baby Jesus. Anna went quietly out of the Church. She went to tell all her friends that she had seen Jesus, God’s own Son. She told about Mary and Joseph’s being in the Temple Church. She must have told everyone how little Baby Jesus looked. Oh, she was so happy!\n\nMary and Joseph stood together in the Church, oh, so quiet, so quiet. They bowed their heads like God wants us to do when we talk to Him. They said, “Thank You God, for giving us Baby Jesus.”\n\nJoseph put down the two pretty birds he had carried all the way from home as a present to God. He left the birds in God’s house.\n\nMary and Joseph walked out of the beautiful Temple Church, into the sunshine. Down the steps they went very, very slowly. They would never make any noise in God’s house, even on the steps. Baby Jesus had been to church. It was the first place He ever went away from home. Church is a place for little children as well as grownups to come to learn about Jesus and how to behave in God’s house.",

        "sectionContent": "IN a land far across the ocean there were some men who must have loved God. They were called Wise men because they were very smart and knew many things. These men would sit and look at the sky at night. They watched the stars twinkle. They liked the tiny lights that God had put in the sky.\n\nDid you ever go out at night and look up at the stars? When the sky is dark and the stars are sparkling like little windows in Heaven, you will see that some stars shine brighter than others.\n\nOne night these men saw a really bright star. It was a very big star and it made a brighter light than any of the others. This star seemed to tell them that a King had come to earth from Heaven. That was the star God sent to shine right over the stable where little Baby Jesus was sleeping in the hay. He was a special Baby from Heaven and this was a special star.\n\nGod must have talked to their hearts, because they wanted to go and find Jesus and take Him a present.\n\nThese men didn’t have a car. No one knew what a car was when Jesus was born. They had to go across lots and lots of sand, too. Horses cannot walk in sand very well, so they could not ride horses. There was only one animal that did not mind walking in sand and that was a camel. Camels were made special by God to go across the sandy desert and they do not care if they do not have a drink of water for a long, long time. They do not care if it gets hot in the sand. The men would ride on some camels. That is what they would do and they would find Baby Jesus and take Him something to show how glad they were that God had sent His Son as a little Baby.\n\nHow would they find the way? Why, they would follow that star that God put in the sky that night. It would help them know where to go. They would start right now.\n\nThe camel’s feet went step, step, step, softly over the sandy road. Look, that star looks like it is moving along slowly in front of them. That star seemed to say, “Follow me.”\n\nOn and on they went. They came nearer, and nearer to where Jesus, the little Christ Child, was sleeping. At last they stopped in front of the great gates to the big city of Jerusalem. “Where is Baby Jesus, the King that God sent?” they asked the people.\n\nThe people of Jerusalem had not heard about Jesus being born and they were excited. The King called the Wise men to visit him. He asked what time they had seen the star. He told them to go on and find the Baby and to come back and tell him where Jesus was. He told them the Baby would be somewhere in the town of Bethlehem, to go and look there.\n\nThe Wise men would probably rest in the day time because they could not ride without rest. They liked the night time because the star would shine so brightly they could always look up and see it helping them find their way.\n\nEvery night the great big star would shine. Every night the Wise men followed it. “Come,” the big star seemed to say, “come this way.”\n\nInto the little city of Bethlehem, down a little narrow street, and the star stopped over the house where Baby Jesus lay. The star began to shine and shine real bright now. It had stopped. It did not have to move anymore because God had made His star to guide the Wise men and now they had found what they wanted.\n\nThe Wise men got down off the camels and went in to see the Baby — little Baby Jesus, the new King from Heaven. Oh, how happy they were! They knelt down and prayed by the Baby. They must have thanked God for sending His Son. They put their presents by the Baby.\n\nThe Wise men had come such a long way to see the Baby. They had brought Him wonderful gifts because they loved Him. They knelt down to worship Him, just as we kneel down today when we pray. We do it to show Jesus we love Him more than anyone else. We must love Jesus the best.\n\nThe Wise men brought presents that cost a lot of money. They wanted Jesus to have the very best that they could give.\n\nEach one of us can give Jesus a Christmas-birthday gift that is even better than what the Wise men brought. We can give a present so good that there is no money that can buy it. You cannot buy it anywhere in the world. What is it? You, yourself, alone are the only one who can give this gift. It is the one present that Jesus wants so much that He asks everyone in the world for it.\n\nWhat is this gift that no money can buy and only you can give? It is your own heart, your love, your life.",

        "sectionContent": "IT was night, late at night. Baby Jesus was sleeping all snug and warm. Mary, Jesus’ mother, was sleeping, too, and so was Joseph. God was Jesus’ heavenly Father. Jesus came from Heaven to earth as a little Baby but He was God’s own Son. Joseph was Jesus’ earthly daddy.\n\nWhen all the family was asleep, Joseph had a dream. A dream is when you think or see something in your sleep. Joseph saw an Angel. God sent that Angel to talk to Joseph. “Get up, Joseph, get up,” said the Angel. “Take Baby Jesus away — far away to the land of Egypt. He will be safe from the mean king that wants to kill Jesus.”\n\nThis mean, bad king was the same one who had asked the wise men to find out where Jesus was when He was born and then to come back and tell him where to find the Baby. King Herod said he wanted to go and see the Baby and take Him some presents, too. But he just wanted to hurt Baby Jesus because He knew God sent Jesus from Heaven to be a King, and Herod was afraid Jesus would be King in his place. King Herod did not love God.\n\nJoseph woke up right away. “Mary, Mary,” he said, softly, “an Angel has talked to me in a dream and we must hurry away from here. That mean, bad King Herod wants to hurt our Baby Jesus. We must get up right now and hurry far away into the land of Egypt so that they cannot find us. Baby Jesus will be safe there.”\n\nMary got up out of bed and dressed quickly. She packed the baby things for Baby Jesus. She took some clothes for herself and Joseph, too. She must have made some bundles of food; probably there were no stores along the way.\n\nAfter awhile Joseph brought the little donkey to the house. He tied on the bundles so the donkey could carry them for him.\n\nNow they were all ready to go, so Mary wrapped Baby Jesus up in a little, soft, warm blanket and held Him in her arms. Mary sat on the little donkey’s back and off they went with Joseph leading the donkey down the dark streets and out of the city.\n\nThe stars were shining. It was dark and still. Everyone slept in the little city as Mary and Joseph ‘and Baby Jesus walked along. Clip-clop, clip-clop went the little donkey’s feet. Step, step, step, quietly walked Joseph leading the donkey.\n\nIt was a long, long way to Egypt, the country where they were going. They had to walk all the way. Everyone walked in those days. They must have met many people on the way but no one found out that Mary’s Baby was Baby Jesus.\n\nAfter a long time Mary, Joseph, and Baby Jesus reached their new home. They felt so safe and happy there. Baby Jesus grew bigger and stronger every day. Oh, how Mary loved her little Boy, just like your mother loves you. Joseph was happy because Jesus was such a good Baby Boy. Joseph was glad he had listened to the Angel that night. He was glad that God could see what that mean king was going to do and had taken care of little Jesus. It always pays to mind God.\n\nThen one day God told Joseph something else. God sent another Angel to Joseph in the night. “You may take Mary and little Jesus and go back to your home now,” said the Angel. “That mean, bad king who wanted to hurt little Jesus is not alive any more. Now Jesus will be safe. No one will want to hurt Him.”\n\nHow happy Mary and Joseph were to pack their clothes and some water and food and get ready to go back home again. Now Mary, Joseph, and little Jesus started out again to go that long, long, long road they had traveled once before.\n\nDays and days and days went by. After a while they reached their old home where they had lived before. How happy all the neighbors must have been to see them and how happy they were to be home again! The neighbors and friends were glad to see Baby Jesus, too.\n\nJoseph went to work in his carpenter shop again. Mary did her housework and cooked and washed and took care of Joseph and Jesus.\n\nGod was watching and taking care of Baby Jesus all the time. He watches and takes care of you, too. God gives us water to drink and food to eat. If God did not love us so much He would never have sent Jesus from Heaven to live on earth for a while, just like little boys and girls live today. Jesus knows all about little boys and girls because He was a child one time, too. Mary and Joseph thanked God for helping them keep Baby Jesus safe from the mean King Herod.",

        "sectionContent": "WHEN Jesus was a little boy He lived in the little town of Nazareth. He was always a happy boy as He helped His mother Mary with little errands. He may have helped her carry water from the well. They did not have faucets in the houses like we do now. All the water had to be carried from a well. Perhaps all the people in that little town carried water from the same well.\n\nJesus helped Joseph in his carpenter shop, too. Jesus played with all the other boys and girls that lived near Him. He had lots of fun and everyone loved Him.\n\nThere was one thing that Jesus wanted to do more than anything else. He wanted to go to the big city of Jerusalem and go into the beautiful Temple Church. His mother had taken Him there when He was a little baby but He did not remember about that.\n\nEvery year Jesus’ mother and father used to go with all the rest of the people to a meeting at the big Temple. Jerusalem was a long, long way away and everyone had to walk many, many, many days before they got there.\n\nThis Special Meeting was called the Feast of the Passover. The people always wanted to remember to thank God for helping them to get away from the real mean king when they were way over in Egypt land. God had sent Moses to take the people out a safe way. Every year from that day on, the people gathered together at the big Temple Church and prayed to God and said, “Thank You” to God for saving them from this mean king. Every year they had the Feast of the Passover. We, too, have a special day called Thanksgiving Day, to thank God for all He gives us.\n\nJesus wanted to go every year but Joseph would always tell Him to wait until He was a little older.\n\nOne wonderful day Joseph said to Jesus, “You are twelve years old now so this time you may go on the trip to Jerusalem and pray in the beautiful Temple Church.”\n\nOh, how excited and happy Jesus was! He was going to get to go with all these people He had seen going by on the way to Jerusalem.\n\nIt was a day in spring when Jesus and Mary and Joseph went with some people who were traveling through the little town of Nazareth. They had to walk all the way. It was a long, long way. The big group of people would walk for a long time in the morning and then stop to camp and rest.\n\nAfter awhile they came to a narrow place between some little hills. Perhaps they all stopped in the afternoon, put up their tents and Jesus and the other boys got wood for the fire to cook the dinner.\n\nCan’t you hear the children shouting, “Look, I can see the city over there. I can see the top of the Temple. We are almost there.” How excited Jesus must have been. He was going to get to go to that beautiful House of God at last.\n\nBefore very long Jesus was standing in front of that beautiful Church. It was made of pretty white stones and had a roof of shining gold. It was much, much prettier than Jesus thought it was going to be. It was the most beautiful Church anywhere around.\n\nJesus went inside. Oh, how quiet and still He sat while the people prayed. He did not whisper. No one did. This was the House of God. He heard the beautiful music. He listened to the wise men of the country talking about God. Jesus felt very near to God in the Temple Church. He forgot all about its being time to find His mother and father and get ready to start back home after church was over.\n\nJesus started to talk to these wise, smart men who studied all about God. He was only a boy twelve years old but He knew so much about God that these men were surprised. They asked Him lots and lots of questions that they did not know how to answer and Jesus knew everyone. That was because Jesus was God’s Son. God helped Him to know.\n\nThe men talked and talked to Jesus. Jesus was having such a good time in God’s Church talking about God that He forgot all about the people He had come with; He forgot all about everything. All He thought about was the things of God. He was having a wonderful time.\n\nMary, Joseph and all the rest of the many, many people had started back toward home. They had not missed Jesus. Perhaps He sometimes walked with His mother and sometimes He would walk with His father. When they stopped to make camp, Mary asked, “Where is Jesus?”\n\nWhere was Jesus? No one had seen Jesus. Where could He be? Oh, how bad His mother and father felt. They had to find Jesus.\n\nOn their way back to the city of Jerusalem they asked everyone they met, “Have you seen Jesus?” They looked and looked but they could not find Him in the city streets. Then they hurried to the Church. Could He be there?\n\nYes, there was Jesus sitting with all the wise men and talking about God and the things of Heaven.\n\nMary was so glad to find Him! “Son,” she said, “We have looked everywhere for you. Where have you been?”\n\nJesus answered: “Why did you seek for me? Did you not know I am now working for my Heavenly Father?” Jesus was God’s Son. He was old enough now to work for God.\n\nJesus never forgot the time He went to the beautiful Temple Church and talked to the wise men.",

        "sectionContent": "BEFORE Jesus was born, an angel came from Heaven and told Jesus’ mother she was to have a special little baby boy from God and to name Him Jesus. He was God’s Son and she was to take care of Him for a while.\n\nIn another city lived a preacher and his wife Elizabeth. One day an angel came to them to tell them that they were to have a little boy, too. His name was to be John. He was not God’s Son, but he was going to grow up to tell boys and girls about God’s Son. He would tell men and women how to pray and love Jesus. John was Jesus’ cousin. He was going to tell all the people to be sure and listen to Jesus.\n\nAfter John had grown to be a man, he lived way, way far out in a lonely place where he talked to God and God talked to him.\n\nJohn did not have clothes like other people. His clothes were made of rough camel hair. His belt was made of skin. He did not have all the things to eat that other people had. He ate honey that the bees made in the trees. He ate locusts, too. These locusts were a little bit like a grasshopper but they were real big and the people in that country liked them.\n\nOne day the people saw this man, dressed in camel’s hair, preaching down by the river Jordan. Yes, it was John. God had told John it was time to go and tell all the boys and girls and big people about Jesus.\n\nJohn had something wonderful to tell the people. He said that God was sending His very own Son, Jesus, to talk to them very soon. Jesus would teach them the things they must do, so that they might go to Heaven and see God. He said: “Jesus is my friend. You make Him your friend and listen to what He tells you.”\n\n“You will have to be good,” John would say. “You must be kind to each other and share with your friends. If you know someone who is hungry, and you have something to eat, you must give him some of yours. If you have two coats and you see someone that is cold who does not have any coat at all you must not be selfish; you must give him one of your coats so he can be warm, too.”\n\n“You must never, never, never take something that belongs to someone else and keep it.” John meant not even a little old toy, or doll, or toy car. Not anything at all. You must never take it and keep it for yourself unless your friend gives it to you.\n\n“Wait and watch for Jesus,” said John. “He will be coming this way soon to teach you. He will be walking down here. You listen to Jesus. He can teach you better than I can.”\n\nJohn would baptize people in the river Jordan. He baptized only the ones who prayed and told God they wanted to work for Him and do what God told them to do. To be baptized in water was a way of showing that all sin-spots had been taken out of their heart. God had made their heart clean.\n\nOne day John looked up and there he saw Jesus coming down to the river. Jesus wanted John to baptize Him, too.\n\nOh my, John did not think he was good enough to baptize Jesus! He thought it would be better for Jesus to baptize him.\n\nJesus knew that God wanted all the people who loved Him to be baptized so Jesus wanted to do it, too, even if He was God’s Son. Jesus wanted to teach the people to mind God; and God said people were to be baptized.\n\nInto the river went Jesus and John. Then John put Jesus under the water real quick and up again.\n\nA wonderful thing happened! When Jesus was baptized something sweet and pure and beautiful like a dove came right down from Heaven and sat on Jesus. A Voice came out of Heaven, too. God was talking. He said, “This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.”\n\nSomeday, when you grow up, you will want to be baptized, too, just like Jesus. But you must first be sure that your heart is clean and free from sin before you are baptized.",

        "sectionContent": "PETER and Andrew were busy. They were very busy. Peter and Andrew were brothers who went out in a boat and caught fish for people. They were fishing on the little sea of Galilee.\n\nJesus was walking along the shore. Perhaps He was thinking about all the work He wanted to do. Not work like your daddy does. Jesus wanted to tell all the boys and girls and big people about God. They did not know about God like you do. Jesus had to have some helpers. He could not tell all the people by Himself. There were too many people and too many cities. Jesus had to walk everywhere. Jesus needed somebody to help Him.\n\nJesus watched Peter and Andrew as they put their net into the waters. He called to the brothers: “Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men.”\n\nWhat did Jesus mean by that? He meant instead of catching real fish, Peter and Andrew would go out to the people and tell them about God. They would help people learn to love God.\n\nPeter and Andrew did not say, “Wait a minute, Jesus,” or “Maybe after a while.” No! The minute Jesus asked them to help Him they dropped those nets fast and went right along with Jesus to help Him.\n\nLook! Look! There are three men in a boat near the shore. Two of them are brothers, James and John. The other man was their daddy. These brothers were fishermen, too. They were not fishing today. Their net had a big torn place in it so they were busy fixing the hole.\n\nJesus looked at James and John. They would be fine helpers for Me, thought Jesus. They could tell boys and girls and big people about God in Heaven. It would make them glad to hear how God loves them and wants to help them. So He called to James and John, as He had called Peter and Andrew.\n\nJames and John liked their work catching fish but they loved Jesus more than anything else. They wanted to please Jesus and make Him happy first. Catching fish was good work but helping people to love God was much better work.\n\nSo James and John said good-by to their daddy and went along with Jesus. They left their boat and nets. They left everything right there and followed Jesus.\n\nThat is the way Jesus wants His boys and girls to be, too. When Jesus asks them to do something for Him, He wants them to stop whatever they are doing for themselves and help Him.\n\nYou can be one of Jesus’ very best helpers by telling your friends about Sunday school, and about how Jesus loves them. You can be a very fine helper by praying for someone you know who has a bad hurt or is sick.\n\nJesus found twelve men who were happy to leave their homes and go wherever Jesus asked them to go and do just what Jesus wanted them to do.",

        "sectionContent": "ONE time there was a man so sick he could not walk. He lived in a little town called Capernaum, far across the water. The people there had heard all about Jesus and how He walked from city to city teaching about God and making sick people well. They wished they could see Jesus.\n\nOne happy day Jesus came to the sick man’s town. Jesus was teaching in another house. Oh, how that poor, sick man wanted to see Jesus! The man was so sick and he shook so hard he could not hold his hands still, and someone even had to feed him. How could he get to see Jesus?\n\nThis sick man had some friends. He had one-two-three-four real good friends that came to see him and always tried to help him all they could.\n\nWhen the friends heard about Jesus’ coming to town, they hurried fast to their poor, sick friend’s house. “Jesus is here,” they said, “Jesus is here, the same Jesus who made blind people see and lame men walk. He can help you, too. Jesus can make you well.”\n\n“How can I see Jesus and ask Him to make me well when I cannot even walk to get to the house where He is?” asked the man.\n\nThe four friends looked at their poor, sick friend. They must find some way to take him to see Jesus but how could they do it? They could not just pick him up and carry him; he was too heavy.\n\n“You shall see Jesus,” said one of the friends. “Jesus never has said ‘No’ to anyone who asked Him to heal him, so I know if we can get you where Jesus can see you, He will heal you.”\n\nThe four friends talked together. All of a sudden they had an idea. They thought of just the way to carry their friend. All four of them could help so he would not be too heavy for any one of them, and it would not hurt the sick man either.\n\n“We are going to carry you,” the man’s friends said. “We will each take a corner of your bed, and then we can carry you easily.”\n\nEach of them took a corner of the sick man’s bed-mat and down the street they started with their sick friend. On they went until they came to the house where Jesus was. The house was so full of people they could not get in at the door. There were so many people in that house listening to Jesus teach, there was not room for one more. Four men carrying a poor, sick man would never be able to squeeze in there anywhere.\n\nThe friends would not take their sick friend back home. No, they were close to Jesus and they would find some way to get to Him. What could they do now?\n\nThe houses in that town all had flat roofs on them. They had some steps on the outside wall that went up to the flat roof. “We will carry you up the steps to the flat roof,” the sick man’s friends said. “We have a plan that will get you in to see Jesus.”\n\nUp the steps carefully and slowly went the men with the bed. They did not want to hurt their friend. Soon they were on top of the roof. It was nice and flat up there and no one was in the way, either.\n\nNow they tied a rope on each corner of the bed real tightly so it would not slip. Then, look! Look at what those men are going to do now. They are making a big hole in the roof, a hole big enough to let the bed go down into the room where Jesus was!\n\nThe roof of that house was not made of wood. None of the roofs were. Perhaps it was long, long, thick, heavy tile put together. It made a good, cool roof; it was not hard to make a hole in that place.\n\nWhen the hole was big enough the men lifted up their friend and held his bed right over the hole. Each man held on to the rope on his side, then slowly, slowly, slowly, down, down, down a little more, came the bed-mat with the poor sick man lying on it.\n\nHow surprised the people inside the house were when they saw that man coming down through the hole in the roof! The four friends had let him down right in front of Jesus.\n\nAll the people watched Jesus. What would He do now? Would He make the man well who had been sick for so long? How quiet everyone was.\n\nJesus looked at the sick man; he looked at the sick man’s friends. He knew these friends had faith that Jesus could heal him. Jesus said to the poor sick man, “Son, thy sins be forgiven thee.” He forgave all that man’s naughty sins. Then Jesus said, “Arise, and take up thy bed, and go thy way into thine house.”\n\nDo you know what happened? That man just got right up as well and strong as any man there; he picked up his bed he had been lying on so long, and he walked. He did not shake any more. He was well and strong. Jesus had made him well. He was healed.\n\nHow that man did thank Jesus! He was so happy! His friends were happy, too.\n\nHow glad they were that they had not given up when they could not get into the house! They found a way to get to Jesus. All of us can find Jesus by just praying and talking to Him, just as if He were standing right beside us.\n\nJesus can do the same wonderful things today that He did then. Jesus still heals us when we are sick if we believe He will do it when we ask Him to.",

        "sectionContent": "IT was the Sabbath. Jesus and His helpers were walking to the city of Jerusalem when they came to a pool. It was called “The Pool of Bethesda.” This was a very special pool of water. There was not another one like it.\n\nAt the edge of the pool there was a poor sick man lying on a mat or a hard kind of a bed. This poor, sick man was looking and looking into the water. My, how he did watch the water in the pool! What was he looking for?\n\nHe wanted to be made well. He had not been able to walk or move himself all alone for thirty-eight years. Many sick people had come to this special Pool of Bethesda to be healed.\n\nMost of the time the water was quiet like all pools, but sometimes an angel would stir up the water. The very first one to get into the water, after the angel had been there and made the water move, would be healed. He would be well.\n\nThis poor sick man wanted to be the first one in the water so he could be well too. He wanted to walk again.\n\nAs he lay by the pool he had often seen the water stir and splash, but someone always got in ahead of him. By the time he could get into the water the healing power was all gone again.\n\nThis poor man could not get into the water by himself. He did not have anyone to help him. He would just lie there and watch and watch for the angel to make the water move again. Maybe this time someone would put him in. But no one ever helped him.\n\nOne day the poor sick man looked up. He saw a Man he had never seen at the pool before. This Man looked so good and kind. You know who He was, but the sick man did not.\n\nThe Stranger walked right over to the sick man and asked him if he would like to be well and strong again. Oh, yes, yes. He did want to be well. He did not know the Stranger talking to him was Jesus, but he told Jesus that he had been there for a long, long time and when the water moved he had no one to help him get into it. He said, “While I am trying to get into the water somebody else gets in first.”\n\nThen Jesus said, “Rise, take up thy bed, and walk.”\n\nThe man was so surprised to hear Jesus say that. Of course he did not know He was Jesus. The man did not say, “I can’t walk.” He knew in his heart that he could do what this Man was telling him to do. He felt the Jesus-love touch him.\n\nUp jumped the lame man. Look! Look! He could stand all alone. He had not been able to walk for many, many years. He was standing tall and strong. It felt so good to be able to walk after lying on that old, hard bed for such a long time.\n\nThe man was so happy that he was well and strong again! He did not have to get into the water to be healed. He picked up his bed and looked for Jesus so he could say, Thank You. Jesus was gone.\n\nThe man was so glad to be walking and strong! He went to the Temple Church to say “Thank You” to God. There in the church he met Jesus again, and talked to Him.\n\nThat is the way Jesus does. He helps us. He can still make us well today when we are sick. We can pray and ask Him and He will come with His Jesus-love and take the sickness away.\n\nJesus told the man who had been healed not to sin or do any wrong things any more.\n\nSome men with sin in their hearts saw the man walking around carrying his bed. It was something like a blanket rolled up. They said, “Who told you to carry your bed around on the Sabbath?”\n\nThe lame man told them that Jesus had made him well by the Pool of Bethesda. Jesus had said, “Take up thy bed and walk,” and he did.",

        "sectionContent": "A LONG, long time ago there lived a man named Jonah. In the country where Jonah lived, there was a big city where there were lots of people who did not love God. They would pray to things called idols. These idols were made out of wood or stone.\n\nBecause these people never prayed to God, or thought about God, they got to be very, very naughty and bad. They had sin in their heart. God saw that, and He did not like it. God would send someone to tell them how to pray and get saved, and how to ask God to make their hearts clean from sin.\n\nIt was Jonah whom God told to go to this bad city of Nineveh. Jonah was to teach the people about the real God. God said to tell them that they were to be good or something awful bad would happen, and they would all die.\n\nWhat do you suppose happened? Do you think Jonah went? No, he did not want to go. He just did not want to mind God at all. He was like some little boys and girls who do not want to mind their mothers and daddies.\n\nJonah did not want to help the people in Nineveh. He did not like them. He thought God was so good and kind that He would let them pray and be saved. Jonah did not like them, so he did not want God to like them, either.\n\nGod loves everybody. If they are bad and do not know how to pray and be good, then God wants someone to teach them about God. God wants to help everybody, but Jonah did not.\n\nNo, Jonah did not want to go to the city of Nineveh. He thought he would just go someplace else. He thought he would run away from God, then God could not find him and make him go.\n\nHe did run away, too. He went to a place where he saw some boats going out into the ocean. One boat was going far away to another city. Jonah paid his money and got on that boat. He went down near the bottom of the boat and went to sleep.\n\nPretty soon the wind began to blow real hard. The waves around the boat got higher and higher and bigger and bigger. The boat was tipped this way and that way by the wind and waves. The big waves in the water washed right up where the sailors were working.\n\nOO-OO-OO OO-OO went the wind. The boat went way over on one side then way over on the other side. The storm was so bad now the sailors thought the boat was going to break all to pieces. They were afraid.\n\nEach man called out loud and prayed hard to his own idol god to help them, but of course their gods did not even hear them. Wood and stone-rock cannot hear anything. That did not do any good.\n\nMaybe the boat was too heavy in the water. The men started throwing some things over the edge of the boat into the water. Maybe that would make the boat quit tipping and bouncing on the high rolling waves. No, that did not help either. Oh my, is the boat going to tip over and sink down, down, down into that deep, deep water?\n\nWhere was Jonah all this time? He was still asleep way down in the bottom of the boat. He did not know about the storm.\n\nThe shipmaster found Jonah asleep down there. He scolded Jonah: “What are you doing sleeping here? Don’t you know that we are in trouble? Get up and pray to your God. Maybe your God will hear you and help us.” They had prayed to their gods, but they could not help them.\n\nHow could Jonah pray to God for help now? He had not minded God. He had hid in the boat so God would not find him. He felt very much ashamed.\n\nNo one can hide from God. Jonah knew that now. God can see everywhere and He knew where Jonah was all the time.\n\nJonah had to tell the sailors why he had run away, and why they were in trouble. It was all because Jonah had been disobedient. What were they to do? “You will just have to throw me into the water and get me out of this boat,” said Jonah. “This trouble is all my fault.”\n\nThe men did not want to do that. They did not want to throw Jonah into that cold, cold, deep water. They tried harder than ever to keep the boat from going down, down, down into the deep water. The waves got bigger and bigger than before. The wind blew harder and harder.\n\n“You will have to throw me off this boat into the water,” said Jonah. “God has made this storm to stop me from running away. If you throw me out the wind will stop and the water will not tip your boat over.”\n\nThe men did not want to do it but they knew what Jonah said must be right. They picked up Jonah and threw him into the water. Splash, splash went poor Jonah into all those big waves.\n\nThe minute Jonah was off the boat the wind did stop. It was so nice and quiet. The big waves quit splashing. The boat did not tip anymore. Everything was as still as it was before the storm.\n\nWhat happened to Jonah? As he fell into the water, a special big fish made by God, swam right up and swallowed him. It swallowed Jonah! God had made that fish and there it was to catch Jonah as he went into the water.\n\nJonah began to pray while inside that fish. It swam around with Jonah inside it. Jonah told God how sorry he was for not minding Him. He wished he had gone to Nineveh like God had told him to do.\n\nJonah was in that fish’s dark stomach for three days. Because Jonah was so sorry and had prayed so hard God did not let him get hurt, and kept him alive.\n\nNow Jonah knew that even if people prayed to idols of wood and stone they still might have kind hearts, and God loved them anyway. They just did not know any better, no one had told them. God loved them so much He wanted someone to teach them how to pray to the real God.\n\nGod let Jonah get out of the big fish’s stomach. One day that fish swam up by some ground and spit Jonah out on the ground. Jonah was safe.\n\nJonah went to the bad city of Nineveh. He told all the people about God and how to pray. The people listened. They told God about how sorry they were for all the mean things they had done. Oh, but they were glad to know there was a God who could really hear them and make them happy. Everyone in the whole city was saved. All the sin, all bad things, were washed out of their hearts.\n\nWhat if no one would have told them about God? God needed Jonah to tell them. He needs you, today.\n\nNo one can ever hide from God. He is looking right at you all the time. Maybe your mother and daddy cannot see what you do, but God does. God wants you to work for Him and be a good helper.",

        "sectionContent": "MARY was a lady who loved God. She talked to God every day and always did just what He wanted her to do.\n\nGod had a wonderful surprise for Mary. God even sent a special angel from Heaven, named Gabriel, to tell Mary all about God’s surprise.\n\nOne day Mary was all by herself. All of a sudden an angel came down right out of Heaven and started talking to Mary. Mary could really see the angel.\n\nMary loved God and she knew all about angels but she was a little bit afraid because it was the first time she could really see an angel and this angel was talking to her.\n\nThe angel said, “Fear not, Mary.” The angel told her that God loved her so much, He was going to let her do something for Him that no other lady in all the world would ever get to do.\n\nGod was going to send her a little Baby Boy from Heaven. Mary was going to be His mother. This little Baby Boy was going to be much like the other little baby boys, but He was God’s very own Son. He was the Son of God and His name was to be Jesus. He would be the most wonderful Baby ever born, and grow up to be the most wonderful Man in all the world. He would do great things for people when He was older. He would heal sick people, make them strong, make blind people to see, cause crippled ones to walk. He also would make bad people become good; save them from sin and make them ready for Heaven. What a wonderful Baby was coming!\n\nOne night Joseph, Mary’s husband, had a dream. He saw an angel when he was asleep. The angel told him also that Mary was to be the mother of God’s Son, Jesus. The angel said, “Thou shalt call his name JESUS: for he shall save his people from their sins.”\n\nMary and Joseph were still waiting for Baby Jesus when they had to take a long trip. They had to go far away to another city.\n\nThey did not have any cars then, so Mary rode on a little donkey and Joseph walked along beside her. It was a long, long way to the city of Bethlehem and Mary got so tired. They were far, far from home.\n\nAt last here they were at the city. It was night. Joseph wanted to find a room so Mary could go to bed and rest. They went to an inn where people stayed when they were away from home. Knock, knock, went Joseph. The man came to the door, but told them that there was no room in the inn.\n\nThe only place they could find to stay was in a barn where there was a manger. Hay is so nice and soft so Joseph took Mary to the little stable. The hay smelled sweet and clean.\n\nThat night, in the stable, God sent the dear little Baby to live with Mary and Joseph. They named Him Jesus. God sent the little Baby Jesus as He had promised, God’s very own Son from Heaven. Mary wrapped God’s Baby Jesus in a soft, warm cloth and laid Him down in the manger to sleep. Jesus was a little Baby just as you were when you first came to your daddy and mother.\n\nThis was Jesus’ birthday. This is why we have Christmas.\n\nJesus had come to the world to live, and to grow up to be a wonderful man. He had come for a very special purpose — He was to be the Savior who would save the people from their sins, just as the angel had said. He saves big people and He also saves little boys and girls, and makes them good and happy, too. What a joy it is to remember His birthday at Christmas time!",

        "sectionContent": "IT was a starry night. The little lambs were sleeping with their mother sheep. The shepherds were standing and sitting around the fire talking softly in the cool night air. It was very quiet and still.\n\nAs the shepherds watched the twinkling stars something wonderful happened. Suddenly, quickly the sky was just filled with a bright, bright light and there was an angel from Heaven. The light was so bright, it perhaps hurt the shepherds’ eyes. It wasn’t like any light they had ever seen before. They had never seen an angel before, either; and they were afraid.\n\nThen the angel talked to the shepherds way out there in the hill near Bethlehem. The angel in the bright light said, “Fear not: for, behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people.”\n\nThe shepherd men stood very still as the angel talked to them. They listened to every word. The angel said that a Baby was born, “You will find the Baby Jesus, and His mother Mary, and Joseph. The Baby is sleeping in the hay in a manger.”\n\nQuickly, again, even before the shepherds could say a word, they heard some beautiful, beautiful music coming from the sky. The whole big sky was filled with more, and more, and more angels. They were singing a beautiful song, “Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men.”\n\nThe singing filled the air. None of the shepherds had ever heard such pretty singing. Only the angels could sing like that.\n\nNow the light began to go away from the sky. It went away just a little more and a little more until the shepherds could hardly see it. The singing and the angels went away, too; the singing got softer and softer until it couldn’t be heard at all. The light was gone. The angels were gone; the music was all gone. It was just as dark and quiet and still as it was before the angels had come. The angels had gone back to Heaven.\n\n“Something wonderful has happened,” said the shepherds to one another. “Let us go and find the Baby Jesus. We will go into the city of Bethlehem and find Him.” He was the Son of God — God’s little Boy.\n\nDown the hillside the shepherds hurried in the cool night. They went along a little road looking for the stable where the Baby Jesus was sleeping.\n\nThere it is. Into the little stable quietly and lovingly went the shepherds. They knelt before the manger where the little Baby Jesus lay. They knelt to show Him how much they loved Him, just as we kneel today when we pray to Jesus. We do it to show Him how much we love Him.\n\nAfter the shepherds had seen the Baby Jesus, they went back to the little lambs and sheep out on the hills near Bethlehem. They always remembered what they saw that night when Jesus was born. They never forgot the beautiful music and the angels from Heaven.\n\nWe are like the shepherds, a little. We don’t take care of any little lambs but we have been told again and again that Jesus is coming to earth. The shepherds knew He was coming someday too, but they didn’t know when. He came as a little Baby then. When Jesus comes back to us He will be the same Jesus. The Baby Jesus grew up and became tall and had a real kind face. He blessed the little children and healed the blind and they could see. He made the sick well and they became strong. The shepherds believed that Jesus would come. He did. We believe that Jesus will come back to get us. He will. We are looking for Him every day, just as they were looking for Him.\n\nThe angels came down from Heaven all of a sudden and talked to the shepherds. Jesus is coming down from Heaven someday, all of a sudden, and He will take all those who love Him and obey Him right into Heaven to live with Him.\n\nWe did not get to go to the stable that day to see little Baby Jesus, but we will see Jesus; when we go to Heaven we will see Mary and Joseph and the shepherds who loved Him.\n\nHow glad the owner of the stable must have felt to have the Baby Jesus come to the stable where the cows and sheep stayed! He did not know that Jesus was coming, but when Mary and Joseph found no other place he made room for them.\n\nJesus’ loving Spirit needs a home on earth today. Jesus’ love cannot live in a house as we do. There is only one place Jesus’ love can live, and that is in a heart. Is Jesus living in your heart?",

        "sectionContent": "MORNING came. This was going to be a happy day for Mary, Joseph, and little Baby Jesus. Jesus was forty days old and He was going to church. It was a long way to the beautiful Temple Church in Jerusalem.\n\nWhen Jesus was a little Baby all the baby boys went to the church when they were forty days old. There in God’s house the mother and father of each little boy would hold their little baby and thank God for giving them a little baby boy to have for their own. Then the father and mother would leave a gift for God in the church to show how happy they were.\n\nMary and Joseph did not have very much money to buy a real big gift so they brought two very pretty birds to give to God in the Temple Church.\n\nThis happy day was a pretty day. The sun came up and warmed the earth. Perhaps Mary and Joseph had to walk to the city of Jerusalem. They did not care. Most people had to walk everywhere they went in those days so they were used to it. Some people rode on donkeys. They walked slowly along. Joseph carried the two pretty birds that they were taking to give to God. Mary carried the Baby. Little Baby Jesus was real little and tiny yet. He was just a little over one month old. He had not been here on earth very long.\n\nThey had walked and walked, and after awhile they saw the big city. Maybe the top of the big Temple Church was so high up in the sky they could even see that. Oh, how happy they were! Now they hurried a little faster. Down this narrow street they went and up that one until they stood in front of God’s Church. How beautiful it looked to them! How quiet they must have felt in their hearts as they looked at it!\n\nEvery boy and every girl has a house where he or she lives. That is their house. God has a house here on earth, too. It is the church. That is God’s house and even if we cannot see Him, God is there in His house. It is not like a house a family has where we can run and play, and jump, and talk any time we want to say something.\n\nGod’s house is a very special place. God wants His little boys and girls to be very quiet in His house. He wants them to be very still so they can learn about Jesus. God wants us to just talk about Him and His Book and learn stories from the Bible. God’s rules are written in the Bible. He tells us how to be good. If we talk, or run in church, God feels very bad.\n\nMary and Joseph knew how to act in God’s house. They went up the steps very softly, just like God was walking right beside them. Into the beautiful Temple Church they went. Inside the door, no one was making any noise, not one noisy sound. Even little Baby Jesus did not cry. He lay very, very still in His mother’s arms. He was not going to be noisy in God’s house.\n\nWhile they were inside the Temple Church, Mary and Joseph met a kind old man who loved little baby boys very much. His name was Simeon. This man was old. He had loved God a long time. When he looked at the Baby which Mary held he knew right away it was God’s Son, the Baby Jesus. God told him in his heart.\n\nSimeon took Baby Jesus in his arms and held Him. Simeon looked at Baby Jesus, then he told Mary and Joseph, that this little Baby Boy was going to grow up to be a good kind Man. He would teach everyone how to be good and to do what God wants them to do. Simeon thanked God for letting him see Baby Jesus. God had let Simeon know that he would get to see God’s Son someday, and here was the Baby Jesus in the Temple Church. Because Simeon loved God so much he even got to hold Baby Jesus.\n\nThere was someone else in the Temple Church that got to see Jesus, too. It was a very old lady named Anna. Anna loved God and did all she could to live just like God wanted her to. God let her see Baby Jesus, too. God told her that Baby Jesus was His Son. How happy Anna was to know this!\n\nAnna was so happy that God had told her that Baby Jesus was His Son that she said, ‘Thank You” to God, for Baby Jesus. Anna went quietly out of the Church. She went to tell all her friends that she had seen Jesus, God’s own Son. She told about Mary and Joseph’s being in the Temple Church. She must have told everyone how little Baby Jesus looked. Oh, she was so happy!\n\nMary and Joseph stood together in the Church, oh, so quiet, so quiet. They bowed their heads like God wants us to do when we talk to Him. They said, “Thank You God, for giving us Baby Jesus.”\n\nJoseph put down the two pretty birds he had carried all the way from home as a present to God. He left the birds in God’s house.\n\nMary and Joseph walked out of the beautiful Temple Church, into the sunshine. Down the steps they went very, very slowly. They would never make any noise in God’s house, even on the steps. Baby Jesus had been to church. It was the first place He ever went away from home. Church is a place for little children as well as grownups to come to learn about Jesus and how to behave in God’s house.",

        "sectionContent": "IN a land far across the ocean there were some men who must have loved God. They were called Wise men because they were very smart and knew many things. These men would sit and look at the sky at night. They watched the stars twinkle. They liked the tiny lights that God had put in the sky.\n\nDid you ever go out at night and look up at the stars? When the sky is dark and the stars are sparkling like little windows in Heaven, you will see that some stars shine brighter than others.\n\nOne night these men saw a really bright star. It was a very big star and it made a brighter light than any of the others. This star seemed to tell them that a King had come to earth from Heaven. That was the star God sent to shine right over the stable where little Baby Jesus was sleeping in the hay. He was a special Baby from Heaven and this was a special star.\n\nGod must have talked to their hearts, because they wanted to go and find Jesus and take Him a present.\n\nThese men didn’t have a car. No one knew what a car was when Jesus was born. They had to go across lots and lots of sand, too. Horses cannot walk in sand very well, so they could not ride horses. There was only one animal that did not mind walking in sand and that was a camel. Camels were made special by God to go across the sandy desert and they do not care if they do not have a drink of water for a long, long time. They do not care if it gets hot in the sand. The men would ride on some camels. That is what they would do and they would find Baby Jesus and take Him something to show how glad they were that God had sent His Son as a little Baby.\n\nHow would they find the way? Why, they would follow that star that God put in the sky that night. It would help them know where to go. They would start right now.\n\nThe camel’s feet went step, step, step, softly over the sandy road. Look, that star looks like it is moving along slowly in front of them. That star seemed to say, “Follow me.”\n\nOn and on they went. They came nearer, and nearer to where Jesus, the little Christ Child, was sleeping. At last they stopped in front of the great gates to the big city of Jerusalem. “Where is Baby Jesus, the King that God sent?” they asked the people.\n\nThe people of Jerusalem had not heard about Jesus being born and they were excited. The King called the Wise men to visit him. He asked what time they had seen the star. He told them to go on and find the Baby and to come back and tell him where Jesus was. He told them the Baby would be somewhere in the town of Bethlehem, to go and look there.\n\nThe Wise men would probably rest in the day time because they could not ride without rest. They liked the night time because the star would shine so brightly they could always look up and see it helping them find their way.\n\nEvery night the great big star would shine. Every night the Wise men followed it. “Come,” the big star seemed to say, “come this way.”\n\nInto the little city of Bethlehem, down a little narrow street, and the star stopped over the house where Baby Jesus lay. The star began to shine and shine real bright now. It had stopped. It did not have to move anymore because God had made His star to guide the Wise men and now they had found what they wanted.\n\nThe Wise men got down off the camels and went in to see the Baby — little Baby Jesus, the new King from Heaven. Oh, how happy they were! They knelt down and prayed by the Baby. They must have thanked God for sending His Son. They put their presents by the Baby.\n\nThe Wise men had come such a long way to see the Baby. They had brought Him wonderful gifts because they loved Him. They knelt down to worship Him, just as we kneel down today when we pray. We do it to show Jesus we love Him more than anyone else. We must love Jesus the best.\n\nThe Wise men brought presents that cost a lot of money. They wanted Jesus to have the very best that they could give.\n\nEach one of us can give Jesus a Christmas-birthday gift that is even better than what the Wise men brought. We can give a present so good that there is no money that can buy it. You cannot buy it anywhere in the world. What is it? You, yourself, alone are the only one who can give this gift. It is the one present that Jesus wants so much that He asks everyone in the world for it.\n\nWhat is this gift that no money can buy and only you can give? It is your own heart, your love, your life.",

        "sectionContent": "IT was night, late at night. Baby Jesus was sleeping all snug and warm. Mary, Jesus’ mother, was sleeping, too, and so was Joseph. God was Jesus’ heavenly Father. Jesus came from Heaven to earth as a little Baby but He was God’s own Son. Joseph was Jesus’ earthly daddy.\n\nWhen all the family was asleep, Joseph had a dream. A dream is when you think or see something in your sleep. Joseph saw an Angel. God sent that Angel to talk to Joseph. “Get up, Joseph, get up,” said the Angel. “Take Baby Jesus away — far away to the land of Egypt. He will be safe from the mean king that wants to kill Jesus.”\n\nThis mean, bad king was the same one who had asked the wise men to find out where Jesus was when He was born and then to come back and tell him where to find the Baby. King Herod said he wanted to go and see the Baby and take Him some presents, too. But he just wanted to hurt Baby Jesus because He knew God sent Jesus from Heaven to be a King, and Herod was afraid Jesus would be King in his place. King Herod did not love God.\n\nJoseph woke up right away. “Mary, Mary,” he said, softly, “an Angel has talked to me in a dream and we must hurry away from here. That mean, bad King Herod wants to hurt our Baby Jesus. We must get up right now and hurry far away into the land of Egypt so that they cannot find us. Baby Jesus will be safe there.”\n\nMary got up out of bed and dressed quickly. She packed the baby things for Baby Jesus. She took some clothes for herself and Joseph, too. She must have made some bundles of food; probably there were no stores along the way.\n\nAfter awhile Joseph brought the little donkey to the house. He tied on the bundles so the donkey could carry them for him\n\nNow they were all ready to go, so Mary wrapped Baby Jesus up in a little, soft, warm blanket and held Him in her arms. Mary sat on the little donkey’s back and off they went with Joseph leading the donkey down the dark streets and out of the city.\n\nThe stars were shining. It was dark and still. Everyone slept in the little city as Mary and Joseph ‘and Baby Jesus walked along. Clip-clop, clip-clop went the little donkey’s feet. Step, step, step, quietly walked Joseph leading the donkey.\n\nIt was a long, long way to Egypt, the country where they were going. They had to walk all the way. Everyone walked in those days. They must have met many people on the way but no one found out that Mary’s Baby was Baby Jesus.\n\nAfter a long time Mary, Joseph, and Baby Jesus reached their new home. They felt so safe and happy there. Baby Jesus grew bigger and stronger every day. Oh, how Mary loved her little Boy, just like your mother loves you. Joseph was happy because Jesus was such a good Baby Boy. Joseph was glad he had listened to the Angel that night. He was glad that God could see what that mean king was going to do and had taken care of little Jesus. It always pays to mind God.\n\nThen one day God told Joseph something else. God sent another Angel to Joseph in the night. “You may take Mary and little Jesus and go back to your home now,” said the Angel. “That mean, bad king who wanted to hurt little Jesus is not alive any more. Now Jesus will be safe. No one will want to hurt Him.”\n\nHow happy Mary and Joseph were to pack their clothes and some water and food and get ready to go back home again. Now Mary, Joseph, and little Jesus started out again to go that long, long, long road they had traveled once before.\n\nDays and days and days went by. After a while they reached their old home where they had lived before. How happy all the neighbors must have been to see them and how happy they were to be home again! The neighbors and friends were glad to see Baby Jesus, too.\n\nJoseph went to work in his carpenter shop again. Mary did her housework and cooked and washed and took care of Joseph and Jesus.\n\nGod was watching and taking care of Baby Jesus all the time. He watches and takes care of you, too. God gives us water to drink and food to eat. If God did not love us so much He would never have sent Jesus from Heaven to live on earth for a while, just like little boys and girls live today. Jesus knows all about little boys and girls because He was a child one time, too. Mary and Joseph thanked God for helping them keep Baby Jesus safe from the mean King Herod.",

        "sectionContent": "WHEN Jesus was a little boy He lived in the little town of Nazareth. He was always a happy boy as He helped His mother Mary with little errands. He may have helped her carry water from the well. They did not have faucets in the houses like we do now. All the water had to be carried from a well. Perhaps all the people in that little town carried water from the same well.\n\nJesus helped Joseph in his carpenter shop, too. Jesus played with all the other boys and girls that lived near Him. He had lots of fun and everyone loved Him.\n\nThere was one thing that Jesus wanted to do more than anything else. He wanted to go to the big city of Jerusalem and go into the beautiful Temple Church. His mother had taken Him there when He was a little baby but He did not remember about that.\n\nEvery year Jesus’ mother and father used to go with all the rest of the people to a meeting at the big Temple. Jerusalem was a long, long way away and everyone had to walk many, many, many days before they got there.\n\nThis Special Meeting was called the Feast of the Passover. The people always wanted to remember to thank God for helping them to get away from the real mean king when they were way over in Egypt land. God had sent Moses to take the people out a safe way. Every year from that day on, the people gathered together at the big Temple Church and prayed to God and said, “Thank You” to God for saving them from this mean king. Every year they had the Feast of the Passover. We, too, have a special day called Thanksgiving Day, to thank God for all He gives us.\n\nJesus wanted to go every year but Joseph would always tell Him to wait until He was a little older.\n\nOne wonderful day Joseph said to Jesus, “You are twelve years old now so this time you may go on the trip to Jerusalem and pray in the beautiful Temple Church.”\n\nOh, how excited and happy Jesus was! He was going to get to go with all these people He had seen going by on the way to Jerusalem.\n\nIt was a day in spring when Jesus and Mary and Joseph went with some people who were traveling through the little town of Nazareth. They had to walk all the way. It was a long, long way. The big group of people would walk for a long time in the morning and then stop to camp and rest.\n\nAfter awhile they came to a narrow place between some little hills. Perhaps they all stopped in the afternoon, put up their tents and Jesus and the other boys got wood for the fire to cook the dinner.\n\nCan’t you hear the children shouting, “Look, I can see the city over there. I can see the top of the Temple. We are almost there.” How excited Jesus must have been. He was going to get to go to that beautiful House of God at last.\n\nBefore very long Jesus was standing in front of that beautiful Church. It was made of pretty white stones and had a roof of shining gold. It was much, much prettier than Jesus thought it was going to be. It was the most beautiful Church anywhere around.\n\nJesus went inside. Oh, how quiet and still He sat while the people prayed. He did not whisper. No one did. This was the House of God. He heard the beautiful music. He listened to the wise men of the country talking about God. Jesus felt very near to God in the Temple Church. He forgot all about its being time to find His mother and father and get ready to start back home after church was over.\n\nJesus started to talk to these wise, smart men who studied all about God. He was only a boy twelve years old but He knew so much about God that these men were surprised. They asked Him lots and lots of questions that they did not know how to answer and Jesus knew everyone. That was because Jesus was God’s Son. God helped Him to know.\n\nThe men talked and talked to Jesus. Jesus was having such a good time in God’s Church talking about God that He forgot all about the people He had come with; He forgot all about everything. All He thought about was the things of God. He was having a wonderful time.\n\nMary, Joseph and all the rest of the many, many people had started back toward home. They had not missed Jesus. Perhaps He sometimes walked with His mother and sometimes He would walk with His father. When they stopped to make camp, Mary asked, “Where is Jesus?”\n\nWhere was Jesus? No one had seen Jesus. Where could He be? Oh, how bad His mother and father felt. They had to find Jesus.\n\nOn their way back to the city of Jerusalem they asked everyone they met, “Have you seen Jesus?” They looked and looked but they could not find Him in the city streets. Then they hurried to the Church. Could He be there?\n\nYes, there was Jesus sitting with all the wise men and talking about God and the things of Heaven.\n\nMary was so glad to find Him! “Son,” she said, “We have looked everywhere for you. Where have you been?”\n\nJesus answered: “Why did you seek for me? Did you not know I am now working for my Heavenly Father?” Jesus was God’s Son. He was old enough now to work for God.\n\nJesus never forgot the time He went to the beautiful Temple Church and talked to the wise men.",

        "sectionContent": "BEFORE Jesus was born, an angel came from Heaven and told Jesus’ mother she was to have a special little baby boy from God and to name Him Jesus. He was God’s Son and she was to take care of Him for a while.\n\nIn another city lived a preacher and his wife Elizabeth. One day an angel came to them to tell them that they were to have a little boy, too. His name was to be John. He was not God’s Son, but he was going to grow up to tell boys and girls about God’s Son. He would tell men and women how to pray and love Jesus. John was Jesus’ cousin. He was going to tell all the people to be sure and listen to Jesus.\n\nAfter John had grown to be a man, he lived way, way far out in a lonely place where he talked to God and God talked to him.\n\nJohn did not have clothes like other people. His clothes were made of rough camel hair. His belt was made of skin. He did not have all the things to eat that other people had. He ate honey that the bees made in the trees. He ate locusts, too. These locusts were a little bit like a grasshopper but they were real big and the people in that country liked them.\n\nOne day the people saw this man, dressed in camel’s hair, preaching down by the river Jordan. Yes, it was John. God had told John it was time to go and tell all the boys and girls and big people about Jesus.\n\nJohn had something wonderful to tell the people. He said that God was sending His very own Son, Jesus, to talk to them very soon. Jesus would teach them the things they must do, so that they might go to Heaven and see God. He said: “Jesus is my friend. You make Him your friend and listen to what He tells you.”\n\n“You will have to be good,” John would say. “You must be kind to each other and share with your friends. If you know someone who is hungry, and you have something to eat, you must give him some of yours. If you have two coats and you see someone that is cold who does not have any coat at all you must not be selfish; you must give him one of your coats so he can be warm, too.”\n\n“You must never, never, never take something that belongs to someone else and keep it.” John meant not even a little old toy, or doll, or toy car. Not anything at all. You must never take it and keep it for yourself unless your friend gives it to you.\n\n“Wait and watch for Jesus,” said John. “He will be coming this way soon to teach you. He will be walking down here. You listen to Jesus. He can teach you better than I can.”\n\nJohn would baptize people in the river Jordan. He baptized only the ones who prayed and told God they wanted to work for Him and do what God told them to do. To be baptized in water was a way of showing that all sin-spots had been taken out of their heart. God had made their heart clean.\n\nOne day John looked up and there he saw Jesus coming down to the river. Jesus wanted John to baptize Him, too.\n\nOh my, John did not think he was good enough to baptize Jesus! He thought it would be better for Jesus to baptize him.\n\nJesus knew that God wanted all the people who loved Him to be baptized so Jesus wanted to do it, too, even if He was God’s Son. Jesus wanted to teach the people to mind God; and God said people were to be baptized.\n\nInto the river went Jesus and John. Then John put Jesus under the water real quick and up again.\n\nA wonderful thing happened! When Jesus was baptized something sweet and pure and beautiful like a dove came right down from Heaven and sat on Jesus. A Voice came out of Heaven, too. God was talking. He said, “This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.”\n\nSomeday, when you grow up, you will want to be baptized, too, just like Jesus. But you must first be sure that your heart is clean and free from sin before you are baptized.",

        "sectionContent": "PETER and Andrew were busy. They were very busy. Peter and Andrew were brothers who went out in a boat and caught fish for people. They were fishing on the little sea of Galilee.\n\nJesus was walking along the shore. Perhaps He was thinking about all the work He wanted to do. Not work like your daddy does. Jesus wanted to tell all the boys and girls and big people about God. They did not know about God like you do. Jesus had to have some helpers. He could not tell all the people by Himself. There were too many people and too many cities. Jesus had to walk everywhere. Jesus needed somebody to help Him.\n\nJesus watched Peter and Andrew as they put their net into the waters. He called to the brothers: “Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men.”\n\nWhat did Jesus mean by that? He meant instead of catching real fish, Peter and Andrew would go out to the people and tell them about God. They would help people learn to love God.\n\nPeter and Andrew did not say, “Wait a minute, Jesus,” or “Maybe after a while.” No! The minute Jesus asked them to help Him they dropped those nets fast and went right along with Jesus to help Him.\n\nLook! Look! There are three men in a boat near the shore. Two of them are brothers, James and John. The other man was their daddy. These brothers were fishermen, too. They were not fishing today. Their net had a big torn place in it so they were busy fixing the hole.\n\nJesus looked at James and John. They would be fine helpers for Me, thought Jesus. They could tell boys and girls and big people about God in Heaven. It would make them glad to hear how God loves them and wants to help them. So He called to James and John, as He had called Peter and Andrew.\n\nJames and John liked their work catching fish but they loved Jesus more than anything else. They wanted to please Jesus and make Him happy first. Catching fish was good work but helping people to love God was much better work.\n\nSo James and John said good-by to their daddy and went along with Jesus. They left their boat and nets. They left everything right there and followed Jesus.\n\nThat is the way Jesus wants His boys and girls to be, too. When Jesus asks them to do something for Him, He wants them to stop whatever they are doing for themselves and help Him.\n\nYou can be one of Jesus’ very best helpers by telling your friends about Sunday school, and about how Jesus loves them. You can be a very fine helper by praying for someone you know who has a bad hurt or is sick.\n\nJesus found twelve men who were happy to leave their homes and go wherever Jesus asked them to go and do just what Jesus wanted them to do.",

The people there had heard all about Jesus and how He walked from city to city teaching about God and making sick people well. They wished they could see Jesus.\n\nOne happy day Jesus came to the sick man’s town. Jesus was teaching in another house. Oh, how that poor, sick man wanted to see Jesus! The man was so sick and he shook so hard he could not hold his hands still, and someone even had to feed him. How could he get to see Jesus?\n\nThis sick man had some friends. He had one-two-three-four real good friends that came to see him and always tried to help him all they could.\n\nWhen the friends heard about Jesus’ coming to town, they hurried fast to their poor, sick friend’s house. “Jesus is here,” they said, “Jesus is here, the same Jesus who made blind people see and lame men walk. He can help you, too. Jesus can make you well.”\n\n“How can I see Jesus and ask Him to make me well when I cannot even walk to get to the house where He is?” asked the man.\n\nThe four friends looked at their poor, sick friend. They must find some way to take him to see Jesus but how could they do it? They could not just pick him up and carry him; he was too heavy.\n\n“You shall see Jesus,” said one of the friends. “Jesus never has said ‘No’ to anyone who asked Him to heal him, so I know if we can get you where Jesus can see you, He will heal you.”\n\nThe four friends talked together. All of a sudden they had an idea. They thought of just the way to carry their friend. All four of them could help so he would not be too heavy for any one of them, and it would not hurt the sick man either.\n\n“We are going to carry you,” the man’s friends said. “We will each take a corner of your bed, and then we can carry you easily.”\n\nEach of them took a corner of the sick man’s bed-mat and down the street they started with their sick friend. On they went until they came to the house where Jesus was. The house was so full of people they could not get in at the door. There were so many people in that house listening to Jesus teach, there was not room for one more. Four men carrying a poor, sick man would never be able to squeeze in there anywhere.\n\nThe friends would not take their sick friend back home. No, they were close to Jesus and they would find some way to get to Him. What could they do now?\n\nThe houses in that town all had flat roofs on them. They had some steps on the outside wall that went up to the flat roof. “We will carry you up the steps to the flat roof,” the sick man’s friends said. “We have a plan that will get you in to see Jesus.”\n\nUp the steps carefully and slowly went the men with the bed. They did not want to hurt their friend. Soon they were on top of the roof. It was nice and flat up there and no one was in the way, either.\n\nNow they tied a rope on each corner of the bed real tightly so it would not slip. Then, look! Look at what those men are going to do now. They are making a big hole in the roof, a hole big enough to let the bed go down into the room where Jesus was!\n\nThe roof of that house was not made of wood. None of the roofs were. Perhaps it was long, long, thick, heavy tile put together. It made a good, cool roof; it was not hard to make a hole in that place.\n\nWhen the hole was big enough the men lifted up their friend and held his bed right over the hole. Each man held on to the rope on his side, then slowly, slowly, slowly, down, down, down a little more, came the bed-mat with the poor sick man lying on it.\n\nHow surprised the people inside the house were when they saw that man coming down through the hole in the roof! The four friends had let him down right in front of Jesus.\n\nAll the people watched Jesus. What would He do now? Would He make the man well who had been sick for so long? How quiet everyone was.\n\nJesus looked at the sick man; he looked at the sick man’s friends. He knew these friends had faith that Jesus could heal him. Jesus said to the poor sick man, “Son, thy sins be forgiven thee.” He forgave all that man’s naughty sins. Then Jesus said, “Arise, and take up thy bed, and go thy way into thine house.”\n\nDo you know what happened? That man just got right up as well and strong as any man there; he picked up his bed he had been lying on so long, and he walked. He did not shake any more. He was well and strong. Jesus had made him well. He was healed.\n\nHow that man did thank Jesus! He was so happy! His friends were happy, too.\n\nHow glad they were that they had not given up when they could not get into the house! They found a way to get to Jesus. All of us can find Jesus by just praying and talking to Him, just as if He were standing right beside us.\n\nJesus can do the same wonderful things today that He did then. Jesus still heals us when we are sick if we believe He will do it when we ask Him to.",
